Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer therapeutics. 
Desmoplastic malignancies, such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), have an abundant 
tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, to date, ICB monotherapy in such 
malignancies has been ineffective. Herein, we identify tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) as the primary source of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 
human and murine CCA. In a murine model of CCA, recruited PD-L1+ TAMs 
facilitated CCA progression. However, TAM blockade failed to decrease tumor 
progression due to a compensatory emergence of granulocytic myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) that mediated immune escape by impairing T cell 
response. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of murine tumor G-MDSCs 
highlighted a unique ApoE G-MDSC subset enriched with TAM blockade; further 
analysis of a human scRNA-Seq data set demonstrated the presence of a similar 
G-MDSC subset in human CCA. Finally, dual inhibition of TAMs and G-MDSCs 
potentiated ICB. In summary, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of 
coupling ICB with immunotherapies targeting immunosuppressive myeloid cells in 
CCA.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can have protumor properties, including 
suppressing immune responses, promoting vascularization and, consequently, 
augmenting tumor progression. To stop TAM-mediated immunosuppression, we use a 
novel treatment by injecting antibodies specific for scavenger receptor MARCO, 
which is expressed on a specific subpopulation of TAMs in the tumor. We now 
report the location of this TAM as well as the pleiotropic mechanism of action 
of anti-MARCO antibody treatment on tumor progression and further show that this 
is potentially relevant to humans. Using specific targeting, we observed 
decreased tumor vascularization, a switch in the metabolic program of 
MARCO-expressing macrophages, and activation of natural killer (NK) cell killing 
through TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). This latter activity 
reverses the effect of melanoma cell-conditioned macrophages in blocking NK 
activation and synergizes with T cell-directed immunotherapy, such as antibodies 
to PD-1 or PD-L1, to enhance tumor killing. Our study thus reveals an approach 
to targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with monoclonal 
antibodies to enhance NK cell activation and NK cell-mediated killing. This can 
complement existing T cell-directed immunotherapy, providing a promising 
approach to combinatorial immunotherapy for cancer.

KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human neoplasia. Despite a large 
investment to understand the effects of KRAS mutation in cancer cells, the 
direct effects of the oncogenetic KRAS activation on immune cells remain 
elusive. Here, we report that extracellular KRASG12D is essential for pancreatic 
tumor-associated macrophage polarization. Oxidative stress induces KRASG12D 
protein release from cancer cells succumbing to autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. 
Extracellular KRASG12D packaged into exosomes then is taken up by macrophages 
through an AGER-dependent mechanism. KRASG12D causes macrophages to switch to an 
M2-like pro-tumor phenotype via STAT3-dependent fatty acid oxidation. 
Consequently, the disruption of KRASG12D release and uptake can abolish the 
macrophage-mediated stimulation of pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mouse models. 
Importantly, the level of KRASG12D expression in macrophages correlates with 
poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients. These findings not only identify 
extracellular KRASG12D as a key mediator of cancer cell-macrophage 
communication, but also provide a novel KRAS-targeted anticancer strategy.

Although pyroptosis is critical for macrophages against pathogen infection, its 
role and mechanism in cancer cells remains unclear. PD-L1 has been detected in 
the nucleus, with unknown function. Here we show that PD-L1 switches 
TNFα-induced apoptosis to pyroptosis in cancer cells, resulting in tumour 
necrosis. Under hypoxia, p-Stat3 physically interacts with PD-L1 and facilitates 
its nuclear translocation, enhancing the transcription of the gasdermin C 
(GSDMC) gene. GSDMC is specifically cleaved by caspase-8 with TNFα treatment, 
generating a GSDMC N-terminal domain that forms pores on the cell membrane and 
induces pyroptosis. Nuclear PD-L1, caspase-8 and GSDMC are required for 
macrophage-derived TNFα-induced tumour necrosis in vivo. Moreover, high 
expression of GSDMC correlates with poor survival. Antibiotic chemotherapy drugs 
induce pyroptosis in breast cancer. These findings identify a non-immune 
checkpoint function of PD-L1 and provide an unexpected concept that 
GSDMC/caspase-8 mediates a non-canonical pyroptosis pathway in cancer cells, 
causing tumour necrosis.

It has long been known that in vitro polarized macrophages differ in morphology. 
Stemming from a conventional immunohistology observation, we set out to test the 
hypothesis that morphology of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in colorectal 
liver metastasis (CLM) represents a correlate of functional diversity with 
prognostic significance. Density and morphological metrics of TAMs were measured 
and correlated with clinicopathological variables. While density of TAMs did not 
correlate with survival of CLM patients, the cell area identified small (S-TAM) 
and large (L-TAM) macrophages that were associated with 5-yr disease-free 
survival rates of 27.8% and 0.2%, respectively (P < 0.0001). RNA sequencing of 
morphologically distinct macrophages identified LXR/RXR as the most enriched 
pathway in large macrophages, with up-regulation of genes involved in 
cholesterol metabolism, scavenger receptors, MERTK, and complement. In 
single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes from CLM tissues, S-TAM and L-TAM 
signatures were differentially enriched in individual clusters. These results 
suggest that morphometric characterization can serve as a simple readout of TAM 
diversity with strong prognostic significance.

Early trials for immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcomas have delivered mixed 
results, and efforts to improve outcomes now look to combinatorial strategies 
with novel immunotherapeutics, including some that target macrophages. To 
enhance our understanding of the sarcoma immune landscape, we quantified and 
characterized tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and expression of the 
targetable macrophage-related immune checkpoint CD47/SIRPα across sarcoma types. 
We surveyed immunohistochemical expression of CD68, CD163, CD47, and SIRPα in 
tissue microarrays of 1242 sarcoma specimens (spanning 24 types). 
Non-translocation sarcomas, particularly undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma 
and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, had significantly higher counts of both 
CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages than translocation-associated sarcomas. Across 
nearly all sarcoma types, macrophages outnumbered tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
and CD163+ (M2-like) macrophages outnumbered CD68+ (M1-like) macrophages. These 
findings were supported by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which showed a 
correlation between increasing macrophage contributions to immune infiltration 
and several measures of DNA damage. CD47 expression was bimodal, with most cases 
showing either 0% or >90% tumor cell staining, and the highest CD47 scores were 
observed in chordoma, angiosarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. SIRPα scores 
correlated well with CD47 expression. Given the predominance of macrophage 
infiltrates over tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the bias toward M2-like 
(immunosuppressive) macrophage polarization, and the generally high scores for 
CD47 and SIRPα, macrophage-focused immunomodulatory agents, such as CD47 or 
IDO-1 inhibitors, may be particularly worthwhile to pursue in sarcoma patients, 
alone or in combination with lymphocyte-focused agents.

Background: Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) have strong plasticity and if 
reprogrammed, can clear tumor cells and regulate the adaptive immune system for 
cancer immunotherapy. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can remove 
ubiquitin (Ub) from Ub-modified substrates, have been associated with oncogenic 
metabolism but are not well-known for regulating TAMs repolarization. Methods: 
The expression of DUB related genes in macrophages (MΦs) was detected by reverse 
transcription-PCR. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to detect the 
changes of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and spleen, including M1 
(CD11b+F4/80+CD86+CD206-), and M2 (CD11b+F4/80+CD86-CD206+) MΦs, and IFN-γ+CD8+T 
cells. A proliferation assay was used to determine the effect of M2 MΦs treated 
with a USP7 inhibitor on T cell proliferation. Western blotting was used to 
detect the expression of USP7 and the activation of the MAPK pathway. The TGCA 
database was used to assess the role of USP7 in the immune microenvironment of 
human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Results: 51 DUB genes were screened and USP7 
was identified as a highly expressed gene in M2 but not M1 MΦs. Specific 
silencing of USP7 using siRNA or USP7 inhibitors led to phenotypical and 
functional changes in M2 MΦs, favoring CD8+T cells proliferation in vitro. USP7 
inhibitors delayed tumor growth in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma, and promoted 
tumor infiltration of M1 MΦs and IFN-γ+CD8+T cells. Depletion of TAMs attenuated 
these therapeutic effects. USP7 inhibition was shown to mediate MΦs 
reprogramming by activating the p38 MAPK pathway. Administration of USP7 
inhibitors increased the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 
tumors, while blocking programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) provided an 
effective anti-tumor response. Clinical databases suggest that high expression 
of USP7 in LUAD was negatively correlated with innate and adaptive immunity. 
Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide evidence to suggest that 
therapeutic approaches targeting USP7, in combination with immunotherapy, should 
be considered for lung cancer treatment.

Solid tumors elicit a detectable immune response including the infiltration of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Unfortunately, this immune response is 
co-opted into contributing toward tumor growth instead of preventing its 
progression. We seek to reestablish an antitumor immune response by selectively 
targeting surface receptors and endogenous signaling processes of the macrophage 
subtypes driving cancer progression. RP-182 is a synthetic 10-mer amphipathic 
analog of host defense peptides that selectively induces a conformational switch 
of the mannose receptor CD206 expressed on TAMs displaying an M2-like phenotype. 
RP-182-mediated activation of this receptor in human and murine M2-like 
macrophages elicits a program of endocytosis, phagosome-lysosome formation, and 
autophagy and reprograms M2-like TAMs to an antitumor M1-like phenotype. In 
syngeneic and autochthonous murine cancer models, RP-182 suppressed tumor 
growth, extended survival, and was an effective combination partner with chemo- 
or immune checkpoint therapy. Antitumor activity of RP-182 was also observed in 
CD206high patient-derived xenotransplantation models. Mechanistically, via 
selective reduction of immunosuppressive M2-like TAMs, RP-182 improved adaptive 
and innate antitumor immune responses, including increased cancer cell 
phagocytosis by reprogrammed TAMs.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play key roles in the 
development of many malignant solid tumors including breast cancer. They are 
educated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote tumor growth, 
metastasis, and therapy resistance. However, the phenotype of TAMs is elusive 
and how to regulate them for therapeutic purpose remains unclear; therefore, 
TAM-targeting therapies have not yet achieved clinical success. The purposes of 
this study were to examine the role of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in 
regulating TAM gene expression and function and to determine if TFEB activation 
can halt breast tumor development.
METHODS: Microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression profile of 
macrophages (MΦs) in the context of breast cancer and to examine the impact of 
TFEB overexpression. Cell culture studies were performed to define the 
mechanisms by which TFEB affects MΦ gene expression and function. Mouse studies 
were carried out to investigate the impact of MΦ TFEB deficiency or activation 
on breast tumor growth. Human cancer genome data were analyzed to reveal the 
prognostic value of TFEB and its regulated genes.
RESULTS: TAM-mimic MΦs display a unique gene expression profile, including 
significant reduction in TFEB expression. TFEB overexpression favorably 
modulates TAM gene expression through multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, 
TFEB upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) expression and autophagy/lysosome 
activities, inhibits NLRP3 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3) inflammasome 
and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α mediated hypoxia response, and thereby 
suppresses an array of effector molecules in TAMs including arginase 1, 
interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1β, IL-6 and prostaglandin E2. MΦ-specific TFEB 
deficiency promotes, while activation of TFEB using the natural disaccharide 
trehalose halts, breast tumor development by modulating TAMs. Analysis of human 
patient genome database reveals that expression levels of TFEB, SOCS3 and PPARγ 
are positive prognostic markers, while HIF-1α is a negative prognostic marker of 
breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies TFEB as a master regulator of TAMs in breast 
cancer. TFEB controls TAM gene expression and function through multiple 
autophagy/lysosome-dependent and independent pathways. Therefore, 
pharmacological activation of TFEB would be a promising therapeutic approach to 
improve the efficacy of existing treatment including immune therapies for breast 
cancer by favorably modulating TAM function and the TME.

BACKGROUND: The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in determining the 
outcome between the antitumor effects of the adaptive immune system and the 
tumor's anti-immunity stratagems, is controversial. Macrophages modulate their 
activities and phenotypes by integration of signals in the tumor 
microenvironment. Depending on how macrophages are activated, they may adopt 
so-called M1-like, antitumor or M2-like, protumor profiles. In many solid 
tumors, a dominance of M2-like macrophages is associated with poor outcomes but 
in some tumor types, strong M1-like profiles are linked to better outcomes. We 
aimed to investigate the interrelationship of these TAM populations to establish 
how they modulate the efficacy of the adaptive immune system in early lung 
cancer.
METHODS: Macrophages from matched lung (non-tumor-associated macrophages 
(NTAMs)) and tumor samples (TAMs) from resected lung cancers were assessed by 
bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Protein expression of genes 
characteristic of M1-like (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9) or M2-like (matrix 
metallopeptidase 12) functions was confirmed by confocal microscopy. 
Immunohistochemistry related the distribution of TAM transcriptomic signatures 
to density of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in tumors and survival 
data from an independent cohort of 393 patients with lung cancer.
RESULTS: TAMs have significantly different transcriptomic profiles from NTAMs 
with >1000 differentially expressed genes. TAMs displayed a strong M2-like 
signature with no significant variation between patients. However, single-cell 
RNA-sequencing supported by immuno-stained cells revealed that additionally, in 
25% of patients the M2-like TAMs also co-expressed a strong/hot M1-like 
signature (M1hot). Importantly, there was a strong association between the 
density of M1hot TAMs and TRM cells in tumors that was in turn linked to better 
survival. Our data suggest a mechanism by which M1hot TAMs may recruit TRM cells 
via CXCL9 expression and sustain them by making available more of the essential 
fatty acids on which TRM depend.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that in early lung cancer, expression of M1-like and 
M2-like gene signatures are not mutually exclusive since the same TAMs can 
simultaneously display both gene-expression profiles. The presence of M1hot TAMs 
was associated with a strong TRM tumor-infiltrate and better outcomes. Thus, 
therapeutic approaches to re-program TAMs to an M1hot phenotype are likely to 
augment the adaptive antitumor responses.

BACKGROUND: The poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
highlights the need for novel strategies against this disease. Our previous 
study suggested the involvement of CCL2 and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) 
in esophageal carcinogenesis. Despite the recognition of TAMs as a promising 
target for cancer treatment, mechanisms underlying its infiltration, activation 
and tumor-promotive function in ESCC remain unknown.
METHODS: Human esophageal tissue array and TCGA database were used to evaluate 
the clinical relevance of CCL2 and TAMs in ESCC. F344 rats and C57BL/6 mice were 
treated with N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) to establish orthotopic models of 
esophageal carcinogenesis. CCL2/CCR2 gene knockout mice and macrophage-specific 
PPARG gene knockout mice were respectively used to investigate the role of 
infiltration and polarization of TAMs in ESCC. CCL2-mediated monocyte chemotaxis 
was estimated in malignantly transformed Het-1A cells. THP-1 cells were used to 
simulate TAMs polarization in vitro. RNA-sequencing was performed to uncover the 
mechanism.
RESULTS: Increasing expression of CCL2 correlated with TAMs accumulation in 
esophageal carcinogenesis, and they both predicts poor prognosis in ESCC cohort. 
Animal studies show blockade of CCL2-CCR2 axis strongly reduces tumor incidence 
by hindering TAMs recruitment and thereby potentiates the antitumor efficacy of 
CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. More importantly, M2 polarization 
increases PD-L2 expression in TAMs, resulting in immune evasion and tumor 
promotion through PD-1 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of CCL2-CCR2 axis in esophageal 
carcinogenesis. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of immune 
evasion mediated by TAMs in ESCC, suggesting the potential of TAMs-targeted 
strategies for ESCC prevention and immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a complex disease with extensive molecular and 
transcriptional heterogeneity. GBM can be subcategorized into four distinct 
subtypes; tumors that shift towards the mesenchymal phenotype upon recurrence 
are generally associated with treatment resistance, unfavorable prognosis, and 
the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages.
RESULTS: We explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of 
mesenchymal-associated tumor-associated macrophages (MA-TAMs), which drive the 
malignant phenotypic state of GBM, and identify macrophage receptor with 
collagenous structure (MARCO) as the most highly differentially expressed gene. 
MARCOhigh TAMs induce a phenotypic shift towards mesenchymal cellular state of 
glioma stem cells, promoting both invasive and proliferative activities, as well 
as therapeutic resistance to irradiation. MARCOhigh TAMs also significantly 
accelerate tumor engraftment and growth in vivo. Moreover, both MA-TAM master 
regulators and their target genes are significantly correlated with poor 
clinical outcomes and are often associated with genomic aberrations in 
neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinases/mammalian target of 
rapamycin/Akt pathway (PI3K-mTOR-AKT)-related genes. We further demonstrate the 
origination of MA-TAMs from peripheral blood, as well as their potential 
association with tumor-induced polarization states and immunosuppressive 
environments.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study characterizes the global transcriptional 
profile of TAMs driving mesenchymal GBM pathogenesis, providing potential 
therapeutic targets for improving the effectiveness of GBM immunotherapy.

Metabolic pathways and inflammatory processes are under circadian regulation. 
Rhythmic immune cell recruitment is known to impact infection outcomes, but 
whether the circadian clock modulates immunometabolism remains unclear. We find 
that the molecular clock Bmal1 is induced by inflammatory stimulants, including 
Ifn-γ/lipopolysaccharide (M1) and tumor-conditioned medium, to maintain 
mitochondrial metabolism under metabolically stressed conditions in mouse 
macrophages. Upon M1 stimulation, myeloid-specific Bmal1 knockout (M-BKO) 
renders macrophages unable to sustain mitochondrial function, enhancing 
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated mitochondrial production of reactive 
oxygen species as well as Hif-1α-dependent metabolic reprogramming and 
inflammatory damage. In tumor-associated macrophages, aberrant Hif-1α activation 
and metabolic dysregulation by M-BKO contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment. Consequently, M-BKO increases melanoma tumor burden, whereas 
administering the SDH inhibitor dimethyl malonate suppresses tumor growth. 
Therefore, Bmal1 functions as a metabolic checkpoint that integrates macrophage 
mitochondrial metabolism, redox homeostasis and effector functions. This 
Bmal1-Hif-1α regulatory loop may provide therapeutic opportunities for 
inflammatory diseases and immunotherapy.

The main challenges for programmed cell death 1(PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) 
checkpoint blockade lie in a lack of sufficient T cell infiltration, tumor 
immunosuppressive microenvironment, and the inadequate tumor accumulation and 
penetration of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. Resetting tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) is a promising strategy to enhance T-cell antitumor immunity and 
ameliorate tumor immunosuppression. Here, mannose-modified macrophage-derived 
microparticles (Man-MPs) loading metformin (Met@Man-MPs) are developed to 
efficiently target to M2-like TAMs to repolarize into M1-like phenotype. 
Met@Man-MPs-reset TAMs remodel the tumor immune microenvironment by increasing 
the recruitment of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissues and decreasing 
immunosuppressive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and 
regulatory T cells. More importantly, the collagen-degrading capacity of Man-MPs 
contributes to the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor interiors and 
enhances tumor accumulation and penetration of anti-PD-1 antibody. These unique 
features of Met@Man-MPs contribute to boost anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, 
improving anticancer efficacy and long-term memory immunity after combination 
treatment. Our results support Met@Man-MPs as a potential drug to improve tumor 
resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.

The respective antitumoral and protumoral roles of M1 and M2 tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM) typify the complexity of macrophage function in cancer. In 
lung cancer, density and topology of distinct TAM phenotypes at the tumor center 
(TC) versus the invasive margin (IM) are largely unknown. Here, we investigated 
TAM subtype density and distribution between TC and IM in human lung cancer and 
TAM associations with overall survival. Macrophages isolated from adjacent 
nontumor tissue (NM), the TC (TC-TAM), and the IM (IM-TAM) were analyzed with 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Lung tumor tissue microarrays from 104 patient samples 
were constructed. M1 and M2 TAMs were identified using multiplex 
immunofluorescence staining and a tumor cell-TAM proximity analysis was 
performed. RNA-seq identified marked differences among NM, TC-TAM, and IM-TAM. 
On the basis of a panel of five selected markers (CD68, IL12, CCR7, CD163, and 
ALOX15), M2 predominance over M1 and M2 proximity to tumor cells was observed, 
especially at IM. Tumor cell proximity to TAM was linked with tumor cell 
survival and hypoxia was associated with accumulation of M2 TAM. Notably, lower 
density of M1 TC-TAM and higher proximity of tumor cells to M2 IM-TAM or lower 
proximity to M1 IM-TAM were linked with poor survival. In addition, three novel 
molecules (UBXN4, MFSD12, and ACTR6) from RNA-seq served as potential prognostic 
markers for lung cancer, and M2 predominance and juxtaposition of M2 TAM near 
tumor cells were associated with poor survival. Together, our results reveal the 
marked heterogeneity of TAM populations in different tumor regions, with M2 TAM 
predominance, particularly at IM. SIGNIFICANCE: This study underlines the 
significance of the density, spatial distribution, and gene expression of TAM 
phenotypes as prognostic factors for overall survival in lung cancer. GRAPHICAL

There has been no significant improvements for immune checkpoint inhibitors 
since its first use. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are critical mediators 
in the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, contributing to the immunosuppressive tumour 
microenvironment. This study aims to investigate the potential role of PD-L1 in 
regulating TAMs in glioblastoma. Gene expression data and clinical information 
of glioma patients were collected from TCGA (n = 614) and CGGA (n = 325) 
databases. Differentially expressed genes between PD-L1high and PD-L1low groups 
were identified and subjected to bioinformatical analysis. We found that PD-L1 
was frequently expressed in gliomas with a grade-dependent pattern. Higher PD-L1 
expression predicted shorter overall survival. Moreover, PD-L1 was positively 
correlated with immunosuppressive cells (macrophage, neutrophil and immature DC) 
and negatively correlated with cytocidal immune cells (CD8+ T cell and Th1). 
Importantly, PD-L1 high expression was significantly correlated with 
M2-polarization of macrophages (M2-TAMs). We conclude that PD-L1 is an 
unfavourable prognostic marker for patients with glioblastoma; PD-L1-mediated 
immunosuppression may attribute to the infiltration and M2-polarization of TAMs.

TGFβ2 is an essential regulator of immune cell functionality, but the mechanisms 
whereby it drives immune infiltration in gastric cancer remain uncertain. The 
Oncomine and Tumor Immunoassay Resource (TIMER) databases were used for 
assessing the expression of TGFβ2, after which TIMER was used to explore the 
relationship between TGFβ2 and tumour immune infiltration. Finally, we assessed 
how TGFβ2 expression correlated with the expression of a set of marker genes 
associated with immune infiltration using TIMER and GEPIA. We determined TGFβ2 
expression to be significantly correlated with outcome in multiple types of 
cancer in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with the effect being particularly 
pronounced in gastric cancer. Furthermore, elevated TGFβ2 expression was found 
to be significantly correlated with gastric cancer N staging, and with the 
expression of a variety of immune markers associated with particular immune cell 
subsets. These results indicate that TGFΒ2 is associated with patient outcome 
and tumour immune cell infiltration in multiple cancer types. This suggests that 
TGFβ2 is a key factor which governs immune cell recruitment to gastric cancer 
tumours, potentially playing a vital role in governing immune cell infiltration 
and thus representing a valuable prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer 
patients.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a more aggressive 
clinical course with extensive inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity. 
Combination of single-cell and bulk tissue transcriptome profiling allows the 
characterization of tumour heterogeneity and identifies the association of the 
immune landscape with clinical outcomes. We identified inter- and intra-tumour 
heterogeneity at a single-cell resolution. Tumour cells shared a high 
correlation amongst stemness, angiogenesis, and EMT in TNBC. A subset of cells 
with concurrent high EMT, stemness and angiogenesis was identified at the 
single-cell level. Amongst tumour-infiltrating immune cells, M2-like 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) made up the majority of macrophages and 
displayed immunosuppressive characteristics. CIBERSORT was applied to estimate 
the abundance of M2-like TAM in bulk tissue transcriptome file from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA). M2-like TAMs were associated with unfavourable prognosis in 
TNBC patients. A TAM-related gene signature serves as a promising marker for 
predicting prognosis and response to immunotherapy. Two commonly used machine 
learning methods, random forest and SVM, were applied to find the genes that 
were mostly associated with M2-like TAM densities in the gene signature. A 
neural network-based deep learning framework based on the TAM-related gene 
signature exhibits high accuracy in predicting the immunotherapy response.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Activation of the antitumor immune response using 
programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockade showed benefit only in a fraction of 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combining PD-1 blockade with 
antiangiogenesis has shown promise in substantially increasing the fraction of 
patients with HCC who respond to treatment, but the mechanism of this 
interaction is unknown.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We recapitulated these clinical outcomes using 
orthotopic-grafted or induced-murine models of HCC. Specific blockade of 
vascular endothelial receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) using a murine antibody significantly 
delayed primary tumor growth but failed to prolong survival, while anti-PD-1 
antibody treatment alone conferred a minor survival advantage in one model. 
However, dual anti-PD-1/VEGFR-2 therapy significantly inhibited primary tumor 
growth and doubled survival in both models. Combination therapy reprogrammed the 
immune microenvironment by increasing cluster of differentiation 8-positive 
(CD8+ ) cytotoxic T cell infiltration and activation, shifting the M1/M2 ratio 
of tumor-associated macrophages and reducing T regulatory cell (Treg) and 
chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2-positive monocyte infiltration in HCC tissue. 
In these models, VEGFR-2 was selectively expressed in tumor endothelial cells. 
Using spheroid cultures of HCC tissue, we found that PD-ligand 1 expression in 
HCC cells was induced in a paracrine manner upon anti-VEGFR-2 blockade in 
endothelial cells in part through interferon-gamma expression. Moreover, we 
found that VEGFR-2 blockade increased PD-1 expression in tumor-infiltrating CD4+ 
cells. We also found that under anti-PD-1 therapy, CD4+ cells promote normalized 
vessel formation in the face of antiangiogenic therapy with anti-VEGFR-2 
antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that dual anti-PD-1/VEGFR-2 therapy has a durable vessel 
fortification effect in HCC and can overcome treatment resistance to either 
treatment alone and increase overall survival in both anti-PD-1 
therapy-resistant and anti-PD-1 therapy-responsive HCC models.

Rationale: STING is a critical player in the innate and adaptive immune system, 
sensing cytosolic DNA to activate the expression of interferon genes and 
regulate T lymphocytes, which drives immunogenic responses to cancer cells. 
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), abundantly present in the tumor 
microenvironment, play a key role in cancer development. Gastric cancer is one 
of the most common and leading causes in cancer-related death worldwide. 
However, studies on the function and regulation of STING in TAMs and their roles 
in gastric cancer progression are still limited. Methods: We analyzed STING and 
CD68 expression of 200 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues by 
immunohistochemistry to identify the prognostic values of STING, as well as the 
correlations between STING and CD68 in gastric cancer. The characteristics of 
STING-altered macrophages, as well as their effects on cancer cell apoptosis and 
T cell differentiation were examined by flow cytometry. Cytokines secreted by 
STING-altered macrophages were identified by the Human Inflammation Array3 kit. 
Concentrations of soluble IL24 and IFN-β were measured by ELISA. In vivo models, 
including spontaneous gastric cancer in p53+/- mice and cell line-based 
xenografts, were established, and clinical benefits of STING-altered macrophages 
were examined. Results: Our study identifies STING as a prognostic factor for 
gastric cancer, and for the first time demonstrated that knocking-down STING and 
STING activation by 2'3'-c-GAMP both promote TAMs polarizing into 
pro-inflammatory subtype and induce apoptosis of gastric cancer cells, 
mechanistically through IL6R-JAK-IL24 pathway. Conclusions : This study 
evaluated effects of targeting STING in TAMs in anti-gastric-cancer therapies. 
Moreover, we unveil a novel function of STING to activate the IL6R-JAK-IL24 
pathway in macrophages.

Prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) play a critical role in prostate cancer 
progression and metastasis, which remains an obstacle for successful prostate 
cancer treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant 
immune cell population within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Systematic 
investigation of the interaction and network signaling between PCSCs and TAMs 
may help in searching for the critical target to suppress PCSCs and metastasis. 
Herein, we demonstrated that TAMs-secreted CCL5 could significantly promote the 
migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer 
cells as well as the self-renewal of PCSCs in vitro. QPCR screening validated 
STAT3 as the most significant response gene in prostate cancer cells following 
CCL5 treatment. RNA-sequencing and mechanistic explorations further revealed 
that CCL5 could promote PCSCs self-renewal and prostate cancer metastasis via 
activating the β-catenin/STAT3 signaling. Notably, CCL5 knockdown in TAMs not 
only significantly suppressed prostate cancer xenografts growth and bone 
metastasis but also inhibited the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of PCSCs in 
vivo. Finally, clinical investigations and bioinformatic analysis suggested that 
high CCL5 expression was significantly correlated with high Gleason grade, poor 
prognosis, metastasis as well as increased PCSCs activity in prostate cancer 
patients. Taken together, TAMs/CCL5 could promote PCSCs self-renewal and 
prostate cancer metastasis via activating β-catenin/STAT3 signaling. This study 
provides a novel rationale for developing TAMs/CCL5 as a potential molecular 
target for PCSCs elimination and metastatic prostate cancer prevention.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have important roles in cancer progression, 
but the signaling behind the formation of protumoral TAM remains understudied. 
Here, by single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed that the pattern recognition 
receptor Mincle was highly expressed in TAM and significantly associated with 
mortality in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Cancer cells markedly 
induced Mincle expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), thus 
promoting cancer progression in invasive lung carcinoma LLC and melanoma B16F10 
in vivo and in vitro Mincle was predominately expressed in the M2-like TAM in 
non-small cell lung carcinoma and LLC tumors, and silencing of Mincle 
unexpectedly promoted M1-like phenotypes in vitro Mechanistically, we discovered 
a novel Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling pathway in TAM needed for executing their 
TLR4-independent protumoral activities. Adoptive transfer of Mincle-silenced 
BMDM significantly suppressed TAM-driven cancer progression in the LLC-bearing 
NOD/SCID mice. By modifying our well-established ultrasound microbubble-mediated 
gene transfer protocol, we demonstrated that tumor-specific silencing of Mincle 
effectively blocked Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling, therefore inhibiting the 
TAM-driven cancer progression in the syngeneic mouse cancer models. Thus, our 
findings highlight the function of Mincle as a novel immunotherapeutic target 
for cancer via blocking the Mincle/Syk/NF-κB circuit in TAM.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment 
influence tumor initiation, invasion and metastasis. Several studies have shown 
that Wnt5a is mainly expressed in the tumor stroma, especially in TAMs. However, 
whether Wnt5a regulates the polarization and biological function of TAMs in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) is incompletely understood.
METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect CD68 and Wnt5a 
expression in colorectal tissues from patients (63 CRC specimens VS 20 normal 
tissues). RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, ELISA and inhibitors were carried out to 
explore the role of Wnt5a in the polarization of TAMs. Clone formation and 
transwell assays were performed to determine the effects of Wnt5a-treated 
macrophages on tumor proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Finally, a 
xenograft model was applied to confirm the effects of Wnt5a+ TAMs on CRC 
tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: We found that high Wnt5a+CD68+/CD68+ TAMs ratio was significantly 
associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients and Wnt5a+ TAM was an M2-like TAM 
subtype. Subsequently, we found that Wnt5a induced macrophages to secrete IL-10, 
which then acted as an autocrine cytokine to induce M2 polarization of these 
macrophages. IL-10 neutralizing antibody completely reversed the pro-M2 effect 
of Wnt5a. Mechanistically, the CaKMII-ERK1/2-STAT3 pathway was required for 
Wnt5a-mediated IL-10 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, Wnt5a-induced M2 
macrophages promoted CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion; knockdown 
of Wnt5a in TAMs significantly impaired the pro-tumor functions of TAMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Wnt5a could induce M2 polarization of TAMs 
by regulating CaKMII-ERK1/2-STAT3 pathway-mediated IL-10 secretion, ultimately 
promoting tumor growth and metastasis of CRC.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells are important 
components of the tumor microenvironment. M2 polarization of TAMs, which is a 
major actor in breast cancer malignancy and metastasis, can be induced by breast 
cancer cells. However, the potential mechanisms of the interaction between 
breast cancer cells and TAMs remain unclear.
METHODS: The candidate breast cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
were analyzed using the GEO database. Functional assays, including MTT assay, 
Transwell assay, and EdU labeling detection, were performed to investigate the 
oncogenic role of linc00514 in breast cancer progression. The co-culture and 
ELISA assays were used to assess the role of linc00514 in macrophage recruitment 
and M2 polarization. RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, and luciferase 
reporter assays were applied to determine the mechanism of linc00514 in breast 
cancer metastasis. Mouse xenograft models, mouse pulmonary metastatic models, 
and mouse primary tumor models were used to assess the role of linc00514 in M2 
macrophage polarization and breast cancer tumorigenicity.
RESULTS: Linc00514 was highly expressed in clinical breast cancer tissues and 
breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of linc00514 promoted the proliferation 
and invasion of breast cancer cells and increased xenograft tumor volumes and 
pulmonary metastatic nodules. Overexpression of linc00514 also increased the 
percentage of macrophages expressing M2 markers CD206 and CD163. 
Mechanistically, linc00514 promoted Jagged1 expression in a transcriptional 
manner by increasing the phosphorylation of a transcription factor STAT3. 
Subsequently, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling pathway promoted IL-4 and IL-6 
secretions in breast cancer cells and ultimately inducing M2 polarization of 
macrophages.
CONCLUSION: Linc00514 plays an important role in regulating breast cancer 
tumorigenicity and M2 macrophage polarization via Jagged1-mediated Notch 
signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a common malignancy of the digestive 
system and is characterized by poor prognosis and early metastasis. Tumor immune 
escape plays an important role in PC progression. Programmed death 1 (PD1) 
blockade therapy is a promising treatment for patients with PC, but is yet to 
achieve significant clinical effects so far. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a 
soluble dimeric cytokine that is closely associated with tumor immune 
surveillance and cytotoxicity. IFN-γ suppresses a variety of tumor-derived 
cytokines in PC, such as CXCL8. In the present study, we investigated the 
therapeutic efficacy of combined anti-PD1 and IFN-γ treatment in PC.
METHODS: BxPC-3 and Panc-1 human PC cell lines were used to construct a murine 
PC model. Blood samples (n=44) and surgical resection specimens (n=36) from 
human patients with PC were also collected. χ2 test, two-tailed unpaired t-test 
or Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate p values.
RESULTS: PD1/PD-L1 signaling was overexpressed in PC tumor-bearing mice. 
Anti-PD1 prevented tumor growth if initiated early after tumor inoculation; 
however, delayed anti-PD1 treatment showed limited benefit. Murine PC model had 
a preferential expansion of CXCR2+CD68+ macrophages, and these cells showed an 
immunosuppressive nature (M2 polarization). PC tumors overexpressed CXCL8 and 
tumor-derived CXCL8 deficiency prohibited the trafficking of CXCR2+CD68+ 
macrophages. IFN-γ suppressed the expression of tumor-derived CXCL8, and 
combined with IFN-γ treatment, delayed anti-PD1 treatment showed significant 
antitumor effects. Thus, we conclude that murine CXCR2+CD68+ macrophages traffic 
to PC tumors by tumor-derived CXCL8 and mediate local immunosuppression, which 
limits the efficacy of PD1 blockade therapy. IFN-γ suppresses tumor-derived 
CXCL8 and inhibits the tumor trafficking of CXCR2+CD68+ macrophages by blocking 
the CXCL8-CXCR2 axis to enhance anti-PD1 efficacy. Human PC also produces high 
levels of CXCL8. Patients with PC present elevated CXCR2 expression on 
peripheral and tumor-infiltrating CD68+ macrophages, which are associated with 
advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that IFN-γ is a translatable, therapeutic 
option to improve the efficacy of PD1 blockade therapy by preventing trafficking 
of CXCR2+CD68+ macrophages via blocking the CXCL8-CXCR2 axis.

Breast cancer metastases to bone poses a significant challenge for the 
administration of treatment strategies. The bone microenvironment, metastatic 
tumor cells, osteoclasts, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) all play 
crucial and synergistic roles in creating a favorable environment for the 
proliferation, progression, and survival of the metastatic tumor, which in turn 
induces osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. In this study, we functionalized 
immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG)-loaded metal-organic 
framework (MOF) nanoparticles with bone targeting capabilities by surface 
modification with FDA approved antiresorptive bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid 
(ZOL). The functionalized bone targeting immunostimulatory MOF (BT-isMOF) 
nanoparticles demonstrates strong binding to calcium phosphate in vitro and 
exhibits specific targeting and accumulation in bone tissues in vivo. In vitro 
cellular and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the BT-isMOF nanoparticles 
could potently inhibit osteoclast formation and concomitantly induce macrophages 
polarization toward the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Finally, using the 
intratibial murine model of breast cancer bone metastasis, we showed that the 
administration of BT-isMOF nanoparticles significantly suppressed 
osteoclast-mediated bone destruction and enhanced polarization of tumor-resident 
macrophages to M1 phenotype. Together, our data provides promising evidence for 
the potential therapeutic application of the BT-isMOF nanoparticles in the 
treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.

The immune response facilitated by tumor-associated macrophages is a vital 
determinant of tumor progression. We identified differentially expressed genes 
between various macrophage phenotypes in the Gene Expression Omnibus, and used 
Kaplan-Meier Plotter to determine which of them altered the prognosis of 
esophageal carcinoma patients. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), an 
immunosuppressive factor in the tumor microenvironment of various cancers, was 
upregulated in M2 macrophages, and higher FGL2 expression was associated with 
poorer survival in esophageal carcinoma patients. Using the TIMER database, we 
found that FGL2 expression correlated positively with the levels of immune 
markers of infiltrating B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils and dendritic cells in esophageal carcinoma samples. Correlation 
analyses in cBioPortal revealed that the mRNA levels of FGL2 correlated strongly 
with those of interleukin 10, matrix metalloproteinase 9, C-C motif chemokine 
ligand 5, T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3, interleukin 13, vascular cell adhesion 
molecule 1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor and fibroblast growth factor 7 
in esophageal carcinoma tissues. The same cytokines were upregulated when 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells were co-cultured with M2-like 
tumor-associated macrophages. Thus, by secreting FGL2, M2-like tumor-associated 
macrophages may create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that induces 
the occurrence and progression of esophageal carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Crosstalk between cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) mediates tumor progression in colorectal cancer (CRC). Cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation element binding protein 3 (CPEB3) has been shown to exhibit 
tumor-suppressive role in CRC.
METHODS: The expression of CPEB3, CD68, CD86 and CD163 was determined in CRC 
tissues. SW480 or HCT116 cells overexpressing CPEB3 and LoVo or RKO cells with 
CPEB3 knockdown were constructed. Stably transfected CRC cells were co-cultured 
with THP-1 macrophages to determine the malignant phenotype of CRC cells, 
macrophage polarization, and secretory signals. The inhibition of CPEB3 on tumor 
progression and M2-like TAM polarization was confirmed in nude mice.
RESULTS: Decreased CPEB3 expression in CRC was associated with fewer CD86+ TAMs 
and more CD163+ TAMs. CPEB3 knockdown in CRC cells increased the number of 
CD163+ TAMs and the expression of IL1RA, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10 in TAM 
supernatants. TAMs enhanced CRC cell proliferation and invasion via IL-6, and 
then activated the IL-6R/STAT3 pathway in CRC cells. However, CPEB3 reduced the 
IL-6R protein levels by directly binding to IL-6R mRNA, leading to decreased 
phosphorylated-STAT3 expression in CRC cells. CCL2 was significantly increased 
in CPEB3 knockdown cells, while CCL2 antibody treatment rescued the effect of 
CPEB3 knockdown in promoting CD163+ TAM polarization. Eventually, we confirmed 
that CPEB3 inhibits tumor progression and M2-like TAM polarization in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: CPEB3 is involved in the crosstalk between CRC cells and TAMs by 
targeting IL-6R/STAT3 signaling.

A central and unique aspect of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is the 
extensive transcoelomic spreading of tumor cell via the peritoneal fluid or 
malignant ascites. We and others identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) 
in the ascites as promoters of metastasis-associated processes like 
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion, and 
invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of 
TAM are, however, largely unknown. We observed that HGSC migration is promoted 
by soluble mediators from ascites-derived TAM, which can be emulated by 
conditioned medium from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in 
ascites to TAM-like asc-MDM. A similar effect was observed with IL-10-induced 
alternatively activated m2c-MDM but not with LPS/IFNγ-induced inflammatory 
m1-MDM. These observations provided the basis for deconvolution of the complex 
TAM secretome by performing comparative secretome analysis of matched triplets 
of different MDM phenotypes with different pro-migratory properties (asc-MDM, 
m2c-MDM, m1-MDM). Mass spectrometric analysis identified an overlapping set of 
nine proteins secreted by both asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, but not by m1-MDM. Of these, 
three proteins, i.e., transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) protein, 
tenascin C (TNC), and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with 
migration-related functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of 
TGFBI, TNC, and fibronectin were associated with short progression-free 
survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as 
major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM 
in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to 
demonstrate that the migration-inducing potential of asc-MDM and m2c-MDM 
secretomes is inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against 
TGFBI and TNC or siRNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, 
the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAM-derived 
TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.

Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a potent pro-inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, 
including promoting cytotoxic T-cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. 
IL12-based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life-threatening adverse 
effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic 
gene-delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce 
sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of 
the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector 
efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to 
produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due 
to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene-delivery 
vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to 
make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates 
anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for 
instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the 
intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in 
three animal models' with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the 
first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both 
macrophages and tumor cells.

Objective: The transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is critical 
for regulating cytokine and chemokine secretion. However, its function in the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) remains largely unexplored. In this study, we 
characterized the prognostic value of FOXO1 and the interaction between 
tumor-derived FOXO1 and M2 macrophages in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC). Methods: FOXO1 expression and macrophage infiltration in clinical 
samples and mouse models were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry staining. Western blotting, 
qRT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate chemokine 
ligand 20 (CCL20) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) expression in FOXO1(+) 
and FOXO1(-) tumor cells. Macrophage phenotypes were determined using qRT-PCR, 
flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing. Transcriptional activity was measured using 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR. Tumor viability was investigated 
using XTT proliferation and foci formation assays. Results: FOXO1 upregulation 
in tumor tissues was found to drive the polarization of M0 macrophages and 
infiltration of M2 macrophages into the TME, resulting in worse prognosis in 
ESCC patients. CSF-1, a vital factor inducing M0-to-M2 polarization, was 
upregulated via a FOXO1-mediated mechanism. RNA sequencing results corroborated 
that the FOXO1-induced macrophages exhibited similar molecular signatures to the 
IL4-stimulated M2 macrophages. The transwell assays showed that FOXO1 promoted 
the migration of M2 macrophages via CCL20 secretion, which could be inhibited 
using an anti-CCL20 antibody. FOXO1(+) tumor-induced M2 macrophages promoted 
tumor proliferation via the FAK-PI3K-AKT pathway and the PI3K inhibitor could 
effectively impede the oncogenical process. Conclusions: FOXO1 facilitated 
M0-to-M2 polarization and the recruitment of M2 macrophages in the TME via the 
transcriptional modulation of CCL20 and CSF-1. Our data deciphered the 
FOXO1-dependent mechanism in M2 macrophage infiltration in the TME of ESCC, 
which has implications for the development of novel prognostic and therapeutic 
targets to optimize the current treatment against ESCC.

BACKGROUND: Expression of Oct4 maintains cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties 
in lung cancer cells and is correlated with poor prognosis of lung 
adenocarcinoma. M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer cell 
migration and metastasis. Tumor microenvironments promote monocyte 
differentiation into M2 TAMs via a complex cytokine-based connection. We 
explored the role of Oct4 in cytokine secretion in lung cancer and its impact on 
M2 TAM polarization.
METHODS: Monocytes co-cultured with the conditioned medium from 
Oct4-overexpressing lung cancer cells were used to investigate M2 TAM 
differentiation. The inflammatory factors in the conditioned medium of 
Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells were examined using human inflammation antibody 
arrays. The correlations of Oct4, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), 
and M2 TAMs were validated in lung cancer cells, syngeneic mouse lung tumor 
models, and clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
RESULTS: Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells expressed elevated levels of M-CSF, 
which contributed to increased M2 macrophages and enhanced tumor migration. 
Overexpression of Oct4 enhanced tumor growth and reduced the survival of lung 
tumor-bearing mice, which was correlated with increased number of M2 macrophages 
in lung cancer. Notably, NSCLC patients with high expression levels of Oct4, 
M-CSF, and M2 TAMs had the poorest recurrence-free survival. A positive 
correlation between Oct4, M-CSF, and M2 TAMs was observed in the tumor tissue of 
NSCLC patient. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid exerted anti-tumor effects 
and reduced M2 TAMs in tumor-bearing mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Oct4 expressed by lung cancer cells 
promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of M-CSF secretion, 
leading to cancer growth and metastasis. Our findings also implicate that the 
Oct4/M-CSF axis in M2 macrophage polarization may be potential therapeutic 
targets for lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for effective treatments for hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Immunotherapy is promising especially when combined with 
traditional therapies. This study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory 
function of an approved Chinese medicine formula, compound kushen injection 
(CKI), and its anti-HCC efficiency in combination with low-dose sorafenib.
METHODS: Growth of two murine HCC cells was evaluated in an orthotopic model, a 
subcutaneous model, two postsurgical recurrence model, and a tumor rechallenge 
model with CKI and low-dose sorafenib combination treatment. In vivo macrophage 
or CD8+ T cell depletion and in vitro primary cell coculture models were used to 
determine the regulation of CKI on macrophages and CD8+ T cells.
RESULTS: CKI significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of sorafenib at a 
subclinical dose with no obvious side effects. CKI and sorafenib combination 
treatment prevented the postsurgical recurrence and rechallenged tumor growth. 
Further, we showed that CKI activated proinflammatory responses and relieved 
immunosuppression of tumor-associated macrophages in the HCC microenvironment by 
triggering tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1 (TNFR1)-mediated 
NF-κB and p38 MAPK signaling cascades. CKI-primed macrophages significantly 
promoted the proliferation and the cytotoxic ability of CD8+ T cells and 
decreased the exhaustion, which subsequently resulted in apoptosis of HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CKI acts on macrophages and CD8+ T cells to reshape the immune 
microenvironment of HCC, which improves the therapeutic outcomes of low-dose 
sorafenib and avoids adverse chemotherapy effects. Our study shows that 
traditional Chinese medicines with immunomodulatory properties can potentiate 
chemotherapeutic drugs and provide a promising approach for HCC treatment.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of lactic acid on the 
phenotypic polarization and immune function of macrophages. The human 
monocyte/macrophage cell line, THP‑1, was selected and treated with lactic acid. 
Immunofluorescence staining, laser confocal microscopy, reverse‑transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR), western blot, siRNA, and ELISA analyses were 
used to observe changes in the levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)68, 
CD163, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)‑1α, and programmed death ligand‑1 (PD‑L1) 
as well as those of cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α, interferon 
(IFN)‑γ, interleukin (IL)‑12, and IL‑10. THP‑1 macrophages and T cells were 
co‑cultured in vitro to observe the changes in proliferation and apoptosis of T 
cells. The results showed that, lactic acid (15 mmol/l) significantly 
upregulated the expression of the macrophage M2 marker CD163 (P<0.05), 
cytokines, IFN‑γ and IL‑10, secreted by M2‑tumor‑associated macrophages (TAM, 
P<0.05), and HIF‑1α and PD‑L1 (P<0.05), and downregulated the expression of 
cytokines, TNF‑α and IL‑12, secreted by M1‑TAM (P<0.05). Redistribution of 
M2‑TAM subsets and PD‑L1 expression was reversed after further transfection of 
THP‑1 cells with HIF‑1α siRNA (P<0.05). After co‑culturing, T‑cell proliferation 
was inhibited and apoptosis was promoted. In summary, modulation of lactic acid 
level can redistribute M2‑TAM subsets and upregulate PD‑L1 to assist tumor 
immune escape. The HIF‑1α signaling pathway may participate in this process, 
revealing that macrophages, as 'checkpoints' in organisms, are links that 
connect the immune status and tumor evolution, and can be used as a target in 
tumor treatment.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exist in nearly all tumors, and form a major 
part of the tumor microenvironment. TAMs are divided into two groups: 
tumor-suppressing M1 type and tumor-promoting M2 type. Most TAMs are educated by 
the tumor cells to become M2 type, which support tumor growth and make 
immunotherapy ineffective. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is an 
important mechanism for antibody cancer therapy, and this mechanism is dependent 
on TAMs. In this study, we found that the M1 type macrophages elicit a more 
efficient ADCP response than the M2 type, which was confirmed by three tumor 
cell lines, Raji, A431, and SKBR3, along with their corresponding therapeutic 
antibody Rituximab, anti-EGFR mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 528), and 
Trastuzumab, respectively. Resiquimod (R848), an immune system activating agent, 
has been shown to stimulate the M1 type macrophages, and re-educate the TAMs 
from M2 type to M1 type. By treating TAMs with R848, the ADCP response increased 
significantly in vitro and in in vivo mouse xenograft models. R848 encapsulated 
liposomes (R848-LPs) not only accumulated efficiently in the tumor tissues, but 
also distributed in the TAMs. Synergizing the R848-LPs with the anti-EGFR mouse 
monoclonal antibody (clone 528) significantly inhibited WiDr-tumor growth in 
vivo. Our study also revealed that the TAM-targeted delivery of R848 is able to 
re-educate the TAMs to M1 type, enhance the ADCP effect of the antibodies, and 
hence, enhance the anti-tumor effect of the therapeutic antibodies.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) cooperate 
with cancer stem cells (CSC) to maintain stemness. We recently identified 
cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) as a surface marker defining head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) CSC. PI3K-4EBP1-SOX2 activation and signaling 
regulate CSC properties, yet the upstream molecular control of this pathway and 
the mechanisms underlying cross-talk between TAM and CSC in HNSCC remain largely 
unknown. Because CD44 is a molecular mediator in the TME, we propose here that 
TAM-influenced CD44 signaling could mediate stemness via the PI3K-4EBP1-SOX2 
pathway, possibly by modulating availability of hyaluronic acid (HA), the main 
CD44 ligand. HNSCC IHC was used to identify TAM/CSC relationships, and in vitro 
coculture spheroid models and in vivo mouse models were used to identify the 
influence of TAMs on CSC function via CD44. Patient HNSCC-derived TAMs were 
positively and negatively associated with CSC marker expression at noninvasive 
and invasive edge regions, respectively. TAMs increased availability of HA and 
increased cancer cell invasion. HA binding to CD44 increased PI3K-4EBP1-SOX2 
signaling and the CSC fraction, whereas CD44-VCAM-1 binding promoted invasive 
signaling by ezrin/PI3K. In vivo, targeting CD44 decreased PI3K-4EBP1-SOX2 
signaling, tumor growth, and CSC. TAM depletion in syngeneic and humanized mouse 
models also diminished growth and CSC numbers. Finally, a CD44 isoform switch 
regulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity as standard form of CD44 and 
CD44v8-10 determined invasive and tumorigenic phenotypes, respectively. We have 
established a mechanistic link between TAMs and CSCs in HNSCC that is mediated 
by CD44 intracellular signaling in response to extracellular signals. 
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings establish a mechanistic link between tumor cell 
CD44, TAM, and CSC properties at the tumor-stroma interface that can serve as a 
vital area of focus for target and drug discovery.

The immune microenvironment of tumors can play a critical role in promoting or 
inhibiting tumor progression depending on the context. We present evidence that 
tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) can promote tumor progression in 
the sonic hedgehog subgroup of medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). By combining 
longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) and immune 
profiling of a sporadic mouse model of SHH-MB, we found the density of TAMs is 
higher in the ~50% of tumors that progress to lethal disease. Furthermore, 
reducing regulatory T cells or eliminating B and T cells in Rag1 mutants does 
not alter SHH-MB tumor progression. As TAMs are a dominant immune component in 
tumors and are normally dependent on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor 
(CSF1R), we treated mice with a CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622. Significantly, PLX5622 
reduces a subset of TAMs, prolongs mouse survival, and reduces the volume of 
most tumors within 4 weeks of treatment. Moreover, concomitant with a reduction 
in TAMs the percentage of infiltrating cytotoxic T cells is increased, 
indicating a change in the tumor environment. Our studies in an immunocompetent 
preclinical mouse model demonstrate TAMs can have a functional role in promoting 
SHH-MB progression. Thus, CSF1R inhibition could have therapeutic potential for 
a subset of SHH-MB patients.

Stromal stiffening accompanies malignancy, compromises treatment and promotes 
tumour aggression. Clarifying the molecular nature and the factors that regulate 
stromal stiffening in tumours should identify biomarkers to stratify patients 
for therapy and interventions to improve outcome. We profiled lysyl 
hydroxylase-mediated and lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinks and 
quantified the greatest abundance of total and complex collagen crosslinks in 
aggressive human breast cancer subtypes with the stiffest stroma. These tissues 
harbour the highest number of tumour-associated macrophages, whose therapeutic 
ablation in experimental models reduced metastasis, and decreased collagen 
crosslinks and stromal stiffening. Epithelial-targeted expression of the 
crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase, had no impact on collagen crosslinking in 
PyMT mammary tumours, whereas stromal cell targeting did. Stromal cells in 
microdissected human tumours expressed the highest level of collagen 
crosslinking enzymes. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from a cohort of 
patients with breast cancer revealed that stromal expression of lysyl 
hydroxylase 2, an enzyme that induces hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen 
crosslinks and stromal stiffening, correlated significantly with disease 
specific mortality. The findings link tissue inflammation, stromal cell-mediated 
collagen crosslinking and stiffening to tumour aggression and identify lysyl 
hydroxylase 2 as a stromal biomarker.

BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical player in tumor 
progression, metastasis and therapy outcomes. Tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) are a well-recognized core element of the TME and generally characterized 
as M2-like macrophages. TAMs are believed to contribute to tumor progression, 
but the mechanism behind this remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the 
clinical, angiogenic, and lymphangiogenic significance of TAMs in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Utilizing combined immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis, we 
assessed CD68, CD163, VEGF-A, and VEGF-C expression in 349 patients with NSCLC. 
Subsequently, the potential association between M2 TAMs and angiogenic VEGF-A 
and/or lymphangiogenic VEGF-C was evaluated for its prognostic value. 
Furthermore, the effects of M2 TAMs on angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were 
explored via an in vitro co-culture system.
RESULTS: CD68 and CD163 expression were found to directly correlate with VEGF-A 
and/or VEGF-C expression (all p < 0.001). Furthermore, elevated M2 ratio 
(CD163+/CD68+) was significantly associated with poor overall survival 
(p = 0.023). Dual expression of M2 ratiohigh and VEGF-Chigh (M2 
ratiohighVEGF-Chigh) was correlated with worse overall survival (p = 0.033). 
Multivariate analysis revealed that M2 ratiohigh [HR (95% CI) = 1.53 
(1.01-2.33), p = 0.046] and combined M2 ratiohighVEGF-Chigh expression [HR (95% 
CI) = 2.01 (1.28-3.16), p = 0.003] were independent predictors of poor overall 
survival. Notably, we confirmed that M2 macrophages significantly enhanced the 
protein and mRNA expression of both VEGF-A and VEGF-C, while M1 macrophages 
induced only mRNA expression of VEGF-A in A549 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TAMs are significantly associated with 
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, contributing to the progression of NSCLC. 
Furthermore, elevated M2 ratio, similar to combined high M2 ratio and high 
VEGF-C expression, is a strong indicator of poor prognosis in patients with 
NSCLC, providing insight for future TAM-based immunotherapy strategies.

Liver X receptors (LXR) are transcription factors from the nuclear receptor 
family that are activated by oxysterols and synthetic high-affinity agonists. In 
this study, we assessed the antitumor effects of synthetic LXR agonist TO901317 
in a murine model of syngeneic Lewis Lung carcinoma. Treatment with TO901317 
inhibited tumor growth in wild-type, but not in LXR-deficient mice, indicating 
that the antitumor effects of the agonist depends on functional LXR activity in 
host cells. Pharmacologic activation of the LXR pathway reduced the intratumoral 
abundance of regulatory T cells (Treg) and the expression of the Treg-attracting 
chemokine Ccl17 by MHCIIhigh tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Moreover, gene 
expression profiling indicated a broad negative impact of the LXR agonist on 
other mechanisms used by TAM for the maintenance of an immunosuppressive 
environment. In studies exploring the macrophage response to GM-CSF or IL4, 
activated LXR repressed IRF4 expression, resulting in subsequent downregulation 
of IRF4-dependent genes including Ccl17. Taken together, this work reveals the 
combined actions of the LXR pathway in the control of TAM responses that 
contribute to the antitumoral effects of pharmacologic LXR activation. Moreover, 
these data provide new insights for the development of novel therapeutic options 
for the treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals unrecognized roles 
of LXR in the transcriptional control of the tumor microenvironment and suggests 
use of a synthetic LXR agonist as a novel therapeutic strategy to stimulate 
antitumor activity.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the natural compound emodin blocks the 
tumor-promoting feedforward interactions between cancer cells and macrophages, 
and thus ameliorates the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment. 
Since tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) also affect epithelial 
mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) formation, here we aimed 
to test if emodin as a neoadjuvant therapy halts breast cancer metastasis by 
attenuating TAM-induced EMT and CSC formation of breast cancer cells. Methods: 
Bioinformatical analysis was performed to examine the correlation between 
macrophage abundance and EMT/CSC markers in human breast tumors. Cell culture 
and co-culture studies were performed to test if emodin suppresses TGF-β1 or 
macrophage-induced EMT and CSC formation of breast cancer cells, and if it 
inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Using mouse models, we 
tested if short-term administration of emodin before surgical removal of breast 
tumors halts breast cancer post-surgery metastatic recurrence in the lungs. The 
effects of emodin on TGF-β1 signaling pathways in breast cancer cells were 
examined by western blots and immunofluorescent imaging. Results: Macrophage 
abundance positively correlates with EMT and CSC markers in human breast tumors. 
Emodin suppressed TGF-β1 production in breast cancer cells and macrophages and 
attenuated TGF-β1 or macrophage-induced EMT and CSC formation of breast cancer 
cells. Short-term administration of emodin before surgery halted breast cancer 
post-surgery metastatic recurrence in the lungs by reducing tumor-promoting 
macrophages and suppressing EMT and CSC formation in the primary tumors. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that emodin inhibited both canonical and 
noncanonical TGF-β1 signaling pathways in breast cancer cells and suppressed 
transcription factors key to EMT and CSC. Conclusion: Natural compound emodin 
suppresses EMT and CSC formation of breast cancer cells by blocking 
TGF-β1-mediated crosstalk between TAMs and breast cancer cells. Our study 
provides evidence suggesting that emodin harbors the potential for clinical 
development as a new effective and safe agent to halt metastatic recurrence of 
breast cancer.

Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) elicits 
anti-proliferative effects on different tumor cells, including those derived 
from breast cancer. PPARγ is also expressed in several cells of the breast tumor 
microenvironment, among which tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal 
role in tumor progression and metastasis. We explored the ability of synthetic 
and natural PPARγ ligands to modulate TAM polarization. The ligands included 
rosiglitazone (BRL-49653), and two docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) conjugates, 
N-docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl serotonin 
(DHA-5-HT). Human THP-1 monocytic cells were differentiated into M0, M1 and M2 
macrophages that were characterized by qRT-PCR, ELISA and western blotting. A 
TAM-like phenotypic state was generated by adding two different breast cancer 
cell conditioned media (BCC-CM) to the cultures. Macrophages exposed to BCC-CM 
concomitantly exhibited M1 and M2 phenotypes. Interestingly, rosiglitazone, DHEA 
and DHA-5-HT attenuated cytokine secretion by TAMs, and this effect was reversed 
by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. Given the key role played by PPARγ in the 
crosstalk between cancer cells and TAMs in tumor progression, its activation via 
endogenous or synthetic ligands may lead to novel strategies that target both 
epithelial neoplastic cells and the tumor microenvironment.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the tumor 
inflammatory microenvironment and facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Most 
types of tumors aberrantly express microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be transferred 
between cells by exosomes and can regulate gene expression in recipient cells, 
but it remains unclear whether tumor-derived miRNAs are transferred by exosomes 
and regulate the TAM phenotype. We report that mouse 4T1 breast cancer 
cell-derived exosomes enhanced TAM expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and that 
inhibition of 4T1-cell exosome secretion through short hairpin RNA-mediated 
Rab27a/b depletion repressed tumor growth and metastasis and markedly 
downregulated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in a 4T1 breast tumor model. Furthermore, 
miRNA expression profiling revealed that three miRNAs (miR-100-5p, miR-183-5p, 
and miR-125b-1-3p) were considerably more abundant in 4T1 cell exosomes than in 
mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, indicating potential exosome-mediated 
transfer of the miRNAs, and, notably, miR-183-5p was found to be transferred 
from 4T1 cells to macrophages through exosomes. Moreover, PPP2CA was verified as 
an miR-183-5p target gene, and PPP2CA downregulation enhanced NF-κB signaling 
and promoted macrophage expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Lastly, when 
miR-183-5p was downregulated in exosomes through miR-183-5p sponge expression in 
4T1 cells, these 4T1-derived exosomes triggered diminished p65 phosphorylation 
and IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α secretion, and the miRNA downregulation also led to 
repression of tumor growth and metastasis in the 4T1 breast tumor model in vivo. 
Thus, miR-183-5p expressed in tumor cells was transferred to macrophages by 
exosomes and promoted the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting 
PPP2CA expression, which contributed to tumor progression in a breast cancer 
model.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is the cancer type most susceptible to antibodies 
targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and is characterized by scarce 
Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSCs), perpetuating a unique tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Although anti-PD1 effects appear to be largely mediated 
by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in solid tumors, HRSCs frequently lack major 
histocompatibility complex expression, and the mechanism of anti-PD1 efficacy in 
cHL is unclear. Rapid clinical responses and high interim complete response 
rates to anti-PD1 based first-line treatment were recently reported for patients 
with early-stage unfavorable cHL treated in the German Hodgkin Study Group phase 
2 NIVAHL trial. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this very early 
response to anti-PD1 treatment, we analyzed paired biopsies and blood samples 
obtained from NIVAHL patients before and during the first days of nivolumab 
first-line cHL therapy. Mirroring the rapid clinical response, HRSCs had 
disappeared from the tissue within days after the first nivolumab application. 
The TME already shows a reduction in type 1 regulatory T cells and PD-L1+ 
tumor-associated macrophages at this early time point of treatment. 
Interestingly, a cytotoxic immune response and a clonal T-cell expansion were 
not observed in the tumors or peripheral blood. These early changes in the TME 
were distinct from alterations found in a separate set of cHL biopsies at 
relapse during anti-PD1 therapy. We identify a unique very early histologic 
response pattern to anti-PD1 therapy in cHL that is suggestive of withdrawal of 
prosurvival factors, rather than induction of an adaptive antitumor immune 
response, as the main mechanism of action.

BACKGROUND: Progranulin (PGRN), as a multifunctional growth factor, is 
overexpressed in multiple tumors, but the role of PGRN on tumor immunity is 
still unclear. Here, we studied the effect of PGRN on breast cancer tumor 
immunity and its possible molecular mechanism.
METHODS: The changes of macrophage phenotypes after PGRN treatment were detected 
by western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow 
cytometry. Western blot was used to study the signal molecular mechanism of PGRN 
regulating this process. The number and localization of immune cells in 
Wild-type (WT) and PGRN-/- breast cancer tissues were analyzed by 
immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence techniques. The activation 
and proliferation of CD8+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: After being treated with PGRN, the expressions of M2 markers and 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on macrophages increased significantly. Signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway inhibitor 
Stattic significantly inhibited the expression of PD-L1 and M2 related markers 
induced by PGRN. In WT group, CD8 were co-localized with macrophages and PD-L1, 
but not tumor cells. The number of immune cells in PGRN-/- breast cancer tissue 
increased, and their infiltration into tumor parenchyma was also enhanced. 
Moreover, in the co-culture system, WT peritoneal macrophages not only reduced 
the ratio of activated CD8+ T cells but also reduced the proportion of 
proliferating CD8+ T cells. The addition of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) 
and PD-L1 neutralizing antibodies effectively reversed this effect and restored 
the immune function of CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that PGRN promotes M2 polarization and 
PD-L1 expression by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore, through 
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, PGRN can promote the breast tumor immune escape. Our 
research may provide new ideas and targets for clinical breast cancer 
immunotherapy.

The Glioblastoma (GBM) immune microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor 
development, progression, and prognosis. A comprehensive understanding of the 
intricate milieu and its interactions remains unclear, and single-cell analysis 
is crucially needed. Leveraging mass cytometry (CyTOF), we analyzed immunocytes 
from 13 initial and three recurrent GBM samples and their matched peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (pPBMCs). Using a panel of 30 markers, we provide a 
high-dimensional view of the complex GBM immune microenvironment. Hematoxylin 
and eosin staining and polychromatic immunofluorescence were used for 
verification of the key findings. In the initial and recurrent GBMs, 
glioma-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs) constituted 59.05 and 27.87% of 
the immunocytes, respectively; programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), T cell 
immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte activation gene-3 
(LAG-3), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) 
demonstrated different expression levels in the GAMs among the patients. GAMs 
could be subdivided into different subgroups with different phenotypes. Both the 
exhausted T cell and regulatory T (Treg) cell percentages were significantly 
higher in tumors than in pPBMCs. The natural killer (NK) cells that infiltrated 
into the tumor lesions expressed higher levels of CXC chemokine receptor 3 
(CXCR3), as these cells expressed lower levels of interferon-γ (IFNγ). The 
immune microenvironment in the initial and recurrent GBMs displayed similar 
suppressive changes. Our study confirmed that GAMs, as the dominant infiltrating 
immunocytes, present great inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and that GAMs, 
increased exhausted T cells, infiltrating Tregs, and nonfunctional NK cells 
contribute to local immune suppressive characteristics. Recurrent GBMs share 
similar immune signatures with the initial GBMs except the proportion of GAMs 
decreases.

BACKGROUND: Prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTGIS) is a crucial gene for the 
synthesis of prostaglandin I2, which has multiple roles in inflammation and 
immune modulation. However, studies on the prognostic value of PTGIS and its 
correlation with tumor-infiltrating immune cells in multiple cancers are still 
rare.
RESULTS: Multiple datasets of the Oncomine database showed that PTGIS was 
expressed at low levels in lung cancer and ovarian cancer compared to the levels 
in normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier plotter showed that high PTGIS was associated 
with poor overall survival and progression-free survival in lung, ovarian, and 
gastric cancers. Moreover, PTGIS expression was significantly positively 
correlated with infiltrating levels of macrophages and was strongly associated 
with a variety of immune markers, especially tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
and T-regulatory cells (Tregs).
CONCLUSIONS: High expression of PTGIS could promote the infiltration of TAMs and 
Tregs in the tumor microenvironment and deteriorate outcomes of patients with 
lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers. These findings suggest that PTGIS could be 
taken as a potential biomarker of prognosis and tumor-infiltrating immune cells.
METHODS: PTGIS expression was investigated in different datasets of the Oncomine 
database, and its expression levels in various tumors and corresponding normal 
tissues were analyzed by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). Then, the 
clinical prognostic value of PTGIS was assessed with online public databases. In 
addition, we initially explored the correlation between PTGIS and 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells by TIMER and Gene Expression Profiling 
Interactive Analysis (GEPIA).

Fibroblasts and macrophages play key roles in the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). However, cross-talk between these two kinds of cells has not 
been well studied. Endosialin (CD248/TEM1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that 
is expressed in certain cancer cells, tumor stromal cells, and pericytes. In 
this study, we found that endosialin is mainly expressed in cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAF) in HCC and its expression inversely correlates with patient 
prognosis. Endosialin interacted with CD68 to recruit macrophages and regulated 
expression of GAS6 in CAFs to mediate M2 polarization of macrophages. The fully 
human antibody IgG78 bound glycosylated endosialin and induced its 
internalization in CAFs, thus weakening the cross-talk between CAFs and 
macrophages. In subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models of HCC in nude 
mice, treatment with IgG78 significantly inhibited tumor growth. These results 
indicate that endosialin-positive CAFs promote HCC progression and highlight 
IgG78 as a promising therapeutic candidate for HCC treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: 
These findings highlight CAF-expressed endosialin as a primary regulator of 
macrophage recruitment and polarization and demonstrate endosialin inhibition as 
a potential treatment strategy for HCC. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:

Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the microenvironment of solid 
tumors. The present study displayed histological and immunohistochemical 
analyses of a malignant tumor model developed from cancer stem cells (CSCs) 
converted from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in a cancer 
microenvironment prepared from the conditioned medium (CM) of a pancreatic 
cancer cell line. We focused on the localization and the origin of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), To the best of our knowledge this may be 
the first study to suggest the potential differentiation of CSCs to TAMs. hiPSCs 
were converted into CSCs in the presence of CM from PK8 cells. CSCs were then 
transplanted in vivo and formed primary tumors. Primary cultures for these 
tumors were serially transplanted again to obtain secondary tumors. Secondary 
tumors exhibited histopathological features of malignancy. Cells derived from 
tumors maintained the expression of endogenous stemness markers and pancreatic 
CSCs markers. Simultaneously, high immunoreactivity to anti-mouse CD68, 
anti-human CD68, CD206 and CD11b antibodies were detected revealing that the 
tumor tissue derived from CSCs was enriched for macrophages which can originate 
from both human and mouse cells. The model of CSCs highlighted the possibility 
of CSCs to differentiate into TAMs.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the M2-like phenotype with potent 
immunosuppressive activity, and play a pro-tumor role in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) biology. In this study, we investigated the role of the 
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) as a determinant of TAM 
polarity. Clinical data revealed that the levels of IGFBP2 correlated with M2 
TAMs accumulation and disease progression in human PDAC. In vivo mouse model 
experiments showed that IGFBP2 promoted an immunosuppressive microenvironment 
and tumor growth in a macrophage dependent manner. Bioinformatics analysis of 
PDAC transcriptomes revealed a significant association between IGFBP2 expression 
and M2 macrophage polarization and signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that 
IGFBP2 augmented the expression and secretion of IL-10 through STAT3 activation 
in PDAC cells, which induced TAM polarization toward an M2 phenotype. 
IGFBP2-polarized M2 macrophages significantly increased Tregs infiltration and 
impaired antitumor T-cell immunity in a mouse model. Thus, our investigations 
have illuminated the IGFBP2 signaling pathway that contributes to the 
macrophage-based immunosuppressive microenvironment in PDAC, suggesting that 
blocking the IGFBP2 axis constitutes a potential treatment strategy to reset TAM 
polarization toward an antitumor state in PDAC.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are representing a major leukocyte 
population in solid tumors. Macrophages are very heterogeneous and plastic cells 
and can acquire distinct functional phenotypes ranging from antitumorigenic to 
immunosuppressive tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs, depending on the local tissue 
microenvironment (TME). TAMs express cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and 
extracellular matrix (ECM) modifying factors, and the cross talk with the TME 
regulates pathways involved in the recruitment, polarization, and metabolism of 
TAMs during tumor progression. Due to their crucial role in tumor growth and 
metastasis, selective targeting of TAM for the treatment of cancer with 
therapeutic agents that promote phagocytosis or suppress survival, 
proliferation, trafficking, or polarization of TAMs may prove to be beneficial 
in cancer therapy. In this chapter, we will discuss TAM biology and current 
strategies for the targeting of TAMs using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based 
drugs. In the past few years, advances in the field of nanomedicine pave the way 
for the development of siRNA-based drugs as an additional class of personalized 
cancer immuno-nanomedicines. Fundamental challenges associated with this group 
of therapeutics include the development process, delivery system, and clinical 
translation for siRNA-based drugs.

IL1β is a central mediator of inflammation. Secretion of IL1β typically requires 
proteolytic maturation by the inflammasome and formation of membrane pores by 
gasdermin D (GSDMD). Emerging evidence suggests an important role for IL1β in 
promoting cancer progression in patients, but the underlying mechanisms are 
ill-defined. Here, we have shown a key role for IL1β in driving tumor 
progression in two distinct mouse tumor models. Notably, activation of the 
inflammasome, caspase-8, as well as the pore-forming proteins GSDMD and mixed 
lineage kinase domain-like protein in the host were dispensable for the release 
of intratumoral bioactive IL1β. Inflammasome-independent IL1β release promoted 
systemic neutrophil expansion and fostered accumulation of T-cell-suppressive 
neutrophils in the tumor. Moreover, IL1β was essential for neutrophil 
infiltration triggered by antiangiogenic therapy, thereby contributing to 
treatment-induced immunosuppression. Deletion of IL1β allowed intratumoral 
accumulation of CD8+ effector T cells that subsequently activated 
tumor-associated macrophages. Depletion of either CD8+ T cells or macrophages 
abolished tumor growth inhibition in IL1β-deficient mice, demonstrating a 
crucial role for CD8+ T-cell-macrophage cross-talk in the antitumor immune 
response. Overall, these results support a tumor-promoting role for IL1β through 
establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment and show that inflammasome 
activation is not essential for release of this cytokine in tumors.

Although immunotherapies of tumors have demonstrated promise for altering the 
progression of malignancies, immunotherapies have been limited by an 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that prevents infiltrating immune 
cells from performing their anticancer functions. Prominent among 
immunosuppressive cells are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) that inhibit T cells via release of 
immunosuppressive cytokines and engagement of checkpoint receptors. Here, we 
explore the properties of MDSCs and TAMs from freshly isolated mouse and human 
tumors and find that an immunosuppressive subset of these cells can be 
distinguished from the nonimmunosuppressive population by its upregulation of 
folate receptor beta (FRβ) within the TME and its restriction to the TME. This 
FRβ+ subpopulation could be selectively targeted with folate-linked drugs. 
Delivery of a folate-targeted TLR7 agonist to these cells (i) reduced their 
immunosuppressive function, (ii) increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, (iii) 
enhanced M1/M2 macrophage ratios, (iv) inhibited tumor growth, (v) blocked tumor 
metastasis, and (vi) improved overall survival without demonstrable toxicity. 
These data reveal a broadly applicable strategy across tumor types for 
reprogramming MDSCs and TAMs into antitumorigenic immune cells using a drug that 
would otherwise be too toxic to administer systemically. The data also establish 
FRβ as the first marker that distinguishes immunosuppressive from 
nonimmunosuppressive subsets of MDSCs and TAMs. Because all solid tumors 
accumulate MDSCs and TAMs, a general strategy to both identify and reprogram 
these cells should be broadly applied in the characterization and treatment of 
multiple tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: FRβ serves as both a means to identify and target 
MDSCs and TAMs within the tumor, allowing for delivery of immunomodulatory 
compounds to tumor myeloid cells in a variety of cancers.

BACKGROUND: The impact of growing tumor on polarization and functions of 
tumor-associated macrophages is well known while its influence on residential 
macrophages occupying different anatomical niches reminds to be elucidated.
AIM: To study changes in polarization and functions of macrophages isolated from 
discrete anatomical niches in tumor-bearing mice at different stages of tumor 
growth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ehrlich carcinoma was transplanted intramuscularly to 
Balb/c male mice. On days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after tumor transplantation, 
macrophages from tumor tissue, peritoneal cavity and spleen were isolated and 
analyzed. Nitric oxide production was measured by standard Griess reaction, 
arginase activity was determined by the measurement of urea, reactive oxygen 
species production was checked using NBT dye reduction assay and electron 
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cytotoxic activity was estimated in 
MTT-assay.
RESULTS: Independently of their localization in different anatomic niches, 
macrophages in mice with transplanted Ehrlich carcinoma gradually lose their 
tumoricidal activities while arginase activity is upregulated. This indicates 
the shift of polarization from M1-like towards M2-like phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that growing tumor could be able to 
subvert functioning of macrophages at the systemic level.

BACKGROUND: A bidirectional crosstalk between tumor cells and the surrounding 
microenvironment contributes to tumor progression and response to therapy. Our 
previous studies have demonstrated that bcl-2 affects melanoma progression and 
regulates the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
whether bcl-2 expression in melanoma cells could influence tumor-promoting 
functions of tumor-associated macrophages, a major constituent of the tumor 
microenvironment that affects anticancer immunity favoring tumor progression.
METHODS: THP-1 monocytic cells, monocyte-derived macrophages and melanoma cells 
expressing different levels of bcl-2 protein were used. ELISA, qRT-PCR and 
Western blot analyses were used to evaluate macrophage polarization markers and 
protein expression levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to 
evaluate transcription factor recruitment at specific promoters. Boyden chamber 
was used for migration experiments. Cytofluorimetric and immunohistochemical 
analyses were carried out to evaluate infiltrating macrophages and T cells in 
melanoma specimens from patients or mice.
RESULTS: Higher production of tumor-promoting and chemotactic factors, and 
M2-polarized activation was observed when macrophages were exposed to culture 
media from melanoma cells overexpressing bcl-2, while bcl-2 silencing in 
melanoma cells inhibited the M2 macrophage polarization. In agreement, the 
number of melanoma-infiltrating macrophages in vivo was increased, in parallel 
with a greater expression of bcl-2 in tumor cells. Tumor-derived interleukin-1β 
has been identified as the effector cytokine of bcl-2-dependent macrophage 
reprogramming, according to reduced tumor growth, decreased number of 
M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages and increased number of infiltrating 
CD4+IFNγ+ and CD8+IFNγ+ effector T lymphocytes, which we observed in response to 
in vivo treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist kineret. Finally, in tumor 
specimens from patients with melanoma, high bcl-2 expression correlated with 
increased infiltration of M2-polarized CD163+ macrophages, hence supporting the 
clinical relevance of the crosstalk between tumor cells and microenvironment.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results show that melanoma-specific bcl-2 
controls an IL-1β-driven axis of macrophage diversion that establishes tumor 
microenvironmental conditions favoring melanoma development. Interfering with 
this pathway might provide novel therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key components of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) microenvironment, but their role in CRC prognosis is not fully 
defined.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate prognostic value of different types and 
distribution of TAMs in CRC.
METHODS: Total 27 studies with 6115 patients were searched from PubMed and 
Embase and analyzed to determine the association between TAMs, including 
distinct TAM subsets and infiltration location, and CRC survival. The prognostic 
impact of TAMs on CRC was further stratified by tumor type and mismatch repair 
system (MMR) status.
RESULTS: A pooled analysis indicated that high density of TAMs in CRC tissue was 
significantly associated with favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) but not 
with disease-free survival (DFS). CD 68+ TAM subset correlated with better 
5-year OS, while neither CD68+NOS2+ M1 subset nor CD163+ M2 subset was 
correlated with 5-year OS. Increased CD68+ TAM infiltration in tumor stroma but 
not in tumor islet predicted improved 5-year OS. Stratification by tumor type 
and MMR status showed that in colon cancer or MMR-proficient CRC, elevated TAM 
density was associated with better 5-year OS.
CONCLUSIONS: High infiltration of CD68+ TAMs could be a favorable prognostic 
marker in CRC. Future therapies stimulating CD68+ TAM infiltration may be 
promising in CRC treatment.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major player in the tumor 
microenvironment, were recently recognized as a potential therapeutic target. To 
date, very few anticancer drugs or drug-delivery systems were designed to target 
the TAMs. Inspired by the "eat me" signal, phosphatidylserine (PS), mediated 
phagocytic clearance of apoptotic bodies, in this study, the matrix 
metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)-sensitive PS-modified nanoparticles were developed. 
In the design, the PS is externalized to the nanoparticles' surface only when 
the nanoparticles reach the MMP2-overexpressing tumor site, allowing for the 
TAM-specific phagocytosis. The nanoparticles' excellent macrophage/TAM 
selectivity was observed in various biological models, including various cell 
lines, coculture cells, coculture cell spheroids, zebrafish, and tumor-bearing 
mice. The nanoparticles' TAM specificity remarkably enhanced the TAM depletion 
capability of the loaded model drug, dasatinib, resulting in the improved 
anticancer activity. The MMP2-sensitive apoptotic body-mimicking nanoparticles 
might be a promising delivery tool for TAM-centered cancer diagnoses and 
treatments.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are vital constituents in mediating 
cell-to-cell communication within the tumor microenvironment. However, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between TAMs and tumor cells that 
guide cell fate are largely undetermined. Extracellular vesicles, also known as 
exosomes, which are derived from TAMs, are the components exerting regulatory 
effects. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanism of "onco-vesicles" is of 
crucial importance for prostate cancer (PCa) therapy. In this study, we analyzed 
micro RNA sequences in exosomes released by THP-1 and M2 macrophages and found a 
significant increase in miR-95 levels in TAM-derived exosomes, demonstrating the 
direct uptake of miR-95 by recipient PCa cells. In vitro and in vivo 
loss-of-function assays suggested that miR-95 could function as a tumor promoter 
by directly binding to its downstream target gene, JunB, to promote PCa cell 
proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The clinical 
data analyses further revealed that higher miR-95 expression results in worse 
clinicopathological features. Collectively, our results demonstrated that 
TAM-mediated PCa progression is partially attributed to the aberrant expression 
of miR-95 in TAM-derived exosomes, and the miR-95/JunB axis provides the 
groundwork for research on TAMs to further develop more-personalized therapeutic 
approaches for patients with PCa.

The progression and metastatic capacity of solid tumors are strongly influenced 
by immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), accumulation of anti-inflammatory tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is 
associated with worse clinical outcome and resistance to therapy. Here we 
investigated the immune landscape of NSCLC in the presence of protumoral TAMs 
expressing the macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). 
MARCO-expressing TAM numbers correlated with increased occurrence of regulatory 
T cells and effector T cells and decreased natural killer (NK) cells in these 
tumors. Furthermore, transcriptomic data from the tumors uncovered a correlation 
between MARCO expression and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL37. In vitro 
studies subsequently showed that lung cancer cells polarized macrophages to 
express MARCO and gain an immune-suppressive phenotype through the release of 
IL37. MARCO-expressing TAMs blocked cytotoxic T-cell and NK-cell activation, 
inhibiting their proliferation, cytokine production, and tumor killing capacity. 
Mechanistically, MARCO+ macrophages enhanced regulatory T (Treg) cell 
proliferation and IL10 production and diminished CD8 T-cell activities. 
Targeting MARCO or IL37 receptor (IL37R) by antibody or CRISPR knockout of IL37 
in lung cancer cell lines repolarized TAMs, resulting in recovered cytolytic 
activity and antitumoral capacity of NK cells and T cells and downmodulated Treg 
cell activities. In summary, our data demonstrate a novel immune therapeutic 
approach targeting human TAMs immune suppression of NK- and T-cell antitumor 
activities. SIGNIFICANCE: This study defines tumor-derived IL37 and the 
macrophage scavenger receptor MARCO as potential therapeutic targets to remodel 
the immune-suppressive microenvironment in patients with lung cancer. GRAPHICAL

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important in regulating 
cross-talk between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. TAMs are involved in 
multiple steps of tumor progression and invasion. This study aimed to compare 
CD163 expression with the widely used CD68 pan-macrophage marker in invasive 
breast carcinoma. Furthermore, it focused on assessing the significance of TAMs 
localization in relation to clinicopathological parameters.
RESULTS: CD68 and CD163 immunohistochemical expressions within TAMs infiltrating 
both tumor nest (TN) and tumor stroma (TS) were evaluated in 60 specimens with 
invasive breast carcinoma. High CD68-positive stromal TAMs was significantly 
related to larger tumor, nodal metastasis and vascular invasion (p = 0.003, 
0.037, 0.032, respectively), whereas high CD163-positive stromal TAMs was 
significantly related to larger tumors, nodal metastasis, stage III tumors, 
vascular invasion, estrogen receptor (ER) negativity, and triple-negative 
subtype (p = 0.023, < 0.001, 0.001, 0.022, 0.002, 0.017, respectively). On 
multivariate analysis, high CD68-positive TAMs infiltrating TS was significantly 
associated with larger tumor and positive nodal metastasis (p = 0.006 and 0.016, 
respectively), whereas high CD163 TAMs density within TS was significantly 
associated with positive vascular invasion, nodal metastasis, and molecular 
subtypes (p = 0.003, 0.001, and 0.009, respectively).
CONCLUSION: TAMs within tumor stroma and tumor nest have different levels of 
association with poor prognostic parameters. So, it is of great importance to 
consider the histologic localization of TAMs in addition to the degree of TAMs 
infiltration.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of different cell types, including 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). How 
these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. 
Using G12DKRAS- and V600EBRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the 
pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF 
interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at 
least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine 
macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. 
The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced 
secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the 
mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to 
myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in 
STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases. This work increases our understanding of 
lung adenocarcinoma development and suggests new approaches for therapeutic 
targeting of the TME.

Polarization status of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) plays an essential 
role in tumor growth and invasion. However, emerging treatment like photothermal 
therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) paid little attention on TAMs. In 
recent years, photothermal therapy (PTT) has gained immense attention in the 
anti-tumor strategy field while the effect of PTT on macrophage polarization in 
a tumor microenvironment has rarely been reported. Here, we used graphene oxide 
(GO) combined with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the photothermal material to 
induce heating effect in macrophages to define its anti-tumor effect in vitro 
and in vivo. Firstly, we treated the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with near 
infrared (NIR) light irradiation and detected their polarization status by flow 
cytometric and mRNA expression analysis. Following this, we analyzed the 
migration and invasion ability of an osteosarcoma HOS cell line cultured in a 
conditioned medium (CM) that contains cytokine generated by macrophages with or 
without NIR treatment. Finally, we investigated the in vivo effects of 
NIR-induced macrophage polarization on osteosarcoma growth and invasion. GO-PEG 
(GP) showed great photothermal effect, thermal stability, and biocompatibility 
in vitro and in vivo. Photothermal materials can alleviate interleukin-4-induced 
M2 polarization of macrophages and modulate their anti-tumor capability. Thus, 
the migration and invasion capabilities of HOS cells were weakened, leading to 
an anti-tumor effect in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model. In conclusion, our 
study identified PTT treatment as an approach for preventing osteosarcoma 
invasion by inhibition of M2 polarization.

Young women represent a target of E-cigarette (E-cig) companies, raising concern 
for potential connections with breast cancer (BC) that have not yet been 
elucidated. We hypothesized that E-cig promotes BC development and lung 
metastasis possibly through BC-monocyte/tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) 
crosstalk via CCL5 and V-CAM-1 axes. We demonstrated that E-cig promoted the 
infiltration of circulating monocytes in mammary fat pad (MFP) model. 
Furthermore, E-cig exposure significantly enhanced BC cell growth in MFP tumor 
and metastatic lung colonization; immunohistochemical stains illustrated the 
increase of TAMs infiltration, reduced BC cell apoptosis and increased 
proliferation index after E-cig exposure. In vitro studies show E-cig vapor 
condensate (EVC) treatment upregulated protein expressions of CCL5, V-CAM-1, and 
other pro-tumorigenic factors in BC cells. Mechanistically, co-culture system 
demonstrated both EVC and macrophages independently stimulated BC cell growth 
and the migration via CCL5/CCR1/CCR5 axis. During metastasis, E-Cig exposure 
stimulated BC cell survival via direct interaction with infiltrated macrophages, 
regulated by VCAM-1 and integrin α4β1. Our findings, for the first time, showed 
that E-cig promotes BC growth and metastasis. This study highlights the critical 
role of TAMs via CCL5 and VCAM-1 pathways in E-cig promoted BC tumor 
development.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with an M2-like phenotype have been linked 
to immunosuppression and resistance to chemotherapies of cancer, thus targeting 
TAMs has been an attractive therapeutic strategy to cancer immunotherapy. We 
have reported that the β-D-(1→6) glucan (AAMP-A70) isolated from Amillariella 
Mellea could promote macrophage activation. The present study showed that the 
β-1,6-glucan could promote the transformation of M2-like macrophages to M1-like 
phenotype and inhibit the viability of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. 
On a cellular mechanistic level, the β-1,6-glucan reset tumor-promoting M2-like 
macrophages to tumor-inhibiting M1-like phenotype via increasing the 
phosphorylation of Akt/NF-κB and MAPK. Further, TLR2 was identified as the 
receptor of β-1,6-glucan in the transformation effect. In addition, a very 
similar β-1,6-glucan with side chains of β-Glc or α-Galρ which was purified from 
Lentinus edodes showed same activities with those from Amillariella Mellea. Our 
findings shed light on the action mode of β-1,6-glucan in cancer immunotherapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their M2-type extremely promote tumor 
angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Nogo-B is expressed in most tissues and participates in macrophage polarization. 
However, whether Nogo-B is involved in the polarization and the effects of TAMs 
has been unclear. The expression of Nogo-B in TAMs of HCC patients is 
significantly increased, which correlated with the poor prognosis of the 
patients with HCC. Coincidentally, HCC conditioned medium (HCM) facilitated 
Nogo-B expression and the M2 phenotype of macrophages. Nogo-B knockdown Nogo-B 
significantly suppressed the M2-type polarization of macrophages and inhibited 
HCC cells proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, interference of 
Nogo-B facilitates macrophage-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Nogo-B 
meaningfully enhanced IL4-stimulated the alternative activation of macrophages 
as well as expression of the transcriptional regulators Yes-associated protein 
(Yap)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz). An inhibitor of 
Yap, Verteporfin, could block Nogo-B-Yap/Taz-mediated macrophages M2 
polarization. Nogo-B expression in macrophages facilitates tumor-associated 
macrophages M2 polarization and protumoral effects of TAMs in HCC. Targeting 
Nogo-B/Yap/Taz in macrophages could provide a new therapeutic strategy in HCC 
therapy.

Immune cell infiltration is an important indicator of whether tumor patients 
will benefit from immunotherapy. Gastric cancer is one of the most common tumors 
in the world, and new indicators of immunotherapy are urgently needed. The aim 
of this study was to construct ceRNA networks in gastric cancer with different 
degrees of immune cell infiltration. We analyzed the expression profiles of 
different gastric cancer with different degrees of immune cell infiltration 
retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found differentially 
expressed lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs. A ceRNA regulatory network of gastric 
cancer with different degrees of immune cell infiltration was constructed using 
functional annotation, RNA-RNA interaction prediction, correlation analysis, 
survival analysis, and other comprehensive bioinformatics methods. The 
interaction and correlation between ceRNAs were verified using experiments on 
tumor tissues and cell lines. Cell line experiments showed a potential 
RP11-1094M14.8/miR-1269a/CXCL9 axis that was consistent with the ceRNA theory. 
qRT-PCR results showed that RP11-1094M14.8 knockdown significantly reduced the 
expression of CXCL9, and RP11-1094M14.8 overexpression had the opposite effect. 
The results of clinical analysis of gastric cancer samples showed that 
RP11-1094M14.8 and CXCL9 were highly expressed in hot tumors, and CXCL9 was 
positively correlated with a better prognosis for patients. The constructed 
novel ceRNA network and the potential regulatory axis may provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the potential mechanisms of development in 
gastric cancer with different degrees of immune cell infiltration. The 
RP11-1094M14.8/miR-1269a/CXCL9 axis may serve as a potential immune-therapeutic 
target for gastric cancer with different degrees of immune cell infiltration.

Many advanced cancers are characterized by metabolic disorders. A dietary 
therapeutic strategy was proposed to inhibit tumor growth through administration 
of low-carbohydrate, average-protein, and high-fat diet, which is also known as 
ketogenic diet (KD). In vivo antitumor efficacy of KD on transplanted CT26+ 
tumor cells in BALB/c mice was investigated. The results showed that the KD 
group had significantly higher blood β-hydroxybutyrate and lower blood glucose 
levels when compared with the normal diet group. Meanwhile, KD increased 
intratumor oxidative stress, and TUNEL staining showed KD-induced apoptosis 
against tumor cells. Interestingly, the distribution of CD16/32+ and iNOS+ M1 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) increased in the KD-treated group, with 
concomitantly less arginase-1+ M2 TAMs. Moreover, KD treatment downregulated the 
protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in CT26+ tumor-bearing mice. 
Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of 
HDAC3/PKM2/NF-κB 65/p-Stat3 proteins were reduced in the KD-treated group. Taken 
together, our results indicated that KD can prevent the progression of colon 
tumor via inducing intratumor oxidative stress, inhibiting the expression of the 
MMP-9, and enhancing M2 to M1 TAM polarization. A novel potential mechanism was 
identified that KD can prevent the progression of colon cancer by regulating the 
expression of HDAC3/PKM2/NF-κB65/p-Stat3 axis.

Macrophages are particularly abundant and play an important role throughout the 
tumor progression process, namely, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the 
tumor microenvironment. TAM can be polarized to disparate functional phenotypes, 
the M1 and M2 macrophages. M1-like type macrophages are defined as 
pro-inflammatory cells involved in killing cancer cells, while M2-like type 
cells can specially promote tumor growth and metastasis, tissue remodeling and 
immunosuppression. In this study, we first found that integrin β3 was highly 
expressed on the surface of TAM, both in vivo and in vitro, that displayed the 
M2-like characteristics. Under intervention of CYC or triptolide, the integrin 
β3 inhibitors, the M2 polarization of TAM could be inhibited. Moreover, in the 
cell model of M2 polarization, either blockade or knockout/knockdown of integrin 
β3 could also suppress macrophage M2 polarization, which suggested that the M2 
polarization was dependent on integrin β3. Using knockdown of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), an M2 regulator, we found that 
expression and activation of PPARγ participated in M2 polarization that was 
mediated by integrin β3. Finally, to verify the activity of integrin β3 
inhibitors on TAM in vivo, 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with CYC or 
triptolide; in response, the M1/M2 ratio of TAM was up-regulated, while the 
infiltration of total lymphocytes into tumor tissue was not altered. In general, 
our study found a connection between integrin β3 and macrophage polarization, 
which provides a strategy for facilitating M2 to M1 repolarization and 
reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have recently been reported as an important 
factor in tumor growth and the progression of cancer. The prognostic 
significance of localizations and densities of TAMs in triple negative cancer 
(TNC) of the breast is not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess 
the localizations and densities of the TAMs subtype in TNC and examine their 
clinicopathological features. The study was based on 107 TNC cases operated on 
at Dokkyo Medical University Hospital using the pan-macrophage marker CD68 and 
the M2 macrophage marker CD163 in the tumor stroma (TS) and tumor nest (TN), 
respectively, and examined the clinicopathological significance. Multivariate 
Cox regression analyses revealed that age and CD163+ TAMs in both the TS and TN 
were independent prognostic factors for relapse-free survival and overall 
survival. No correlation was found between the number of CD68+ cells or the 
CD163/CD68 ratio either in TS or TN, or clinicopathological features. Our study 
found that infiltration of CD163+ TAMs, rather than CD68+, in both TS and TN was 
associated with poor prognosis in TNC patients by multivariate analysis. This 
suggests that CD163+ TAMs may affect the prognosis of TNC by not only regulating 
the immune reaction by TAMs in TS, but also because of their direct influence on 
TN.

BACKGROUND: Tissue-resident macrophages can be educated to tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) by the tumor microenvironment and many types of macrophages 
express erythropoietic receptor (EPOR); However, little is known about the 
expression of EPOR on TAMs and the identity of EPOR+ TAMs in osteosarcoma lung 
metastasis has thus far remained elusive.
METHODS: EPOR-eGFPcre mice were used to determine the expression of EPOR on lung 
tissue-resident macrophages. Flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and Western blot were 
examined to define the identity of EPOR+ TAMs in 106 osteosarcoma lung 
metastasis specimens. Moreover, the clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of 
patients with CD163+EPOR+ macrophages were compared.
RESULTS: We found that a subpopulation of mouse lung tissue-resident macrophages 
express EPOR and EPO enhances the proliferation of EPOR+ macrophages in mouse 
lung. A subpopulation of CD163+ macrophages expresses EPOR in human osteosarcoma 
lung metastasis specimens. CD163+EPOR+TAMs increase 2.5 times in human 
osteosarcoma lung metastasis tissues; CD206, CD163, and PD1, which are known to 
have a significant role in TAM function had high expression in CD163+EPOR+ TAMs 
compared with CD163+EPOR- TAMs. Furthermore, CD163+EPOR+ TAMs had higher M2 
marker and cytokine expression in osteosarcoma tissues compared with 
para-osteosarcoma tissues. EPO enhanced the expression of M2 cytokines in 
primary CD163+EPOR+ TAMs. Importantly, the percentage of CD163+EPOR+ TAMs had a 
positive linear association with malignant phenotypes as well as poor 
disease-free survival and overall survival time.
CONCLUSIONS: We have characterized TAMs expressing EPOR and CD163+EPOR+ 
macrophages as TAMs in osteosarcoma lung metastasis patients, which are highly 
associated with tumor aggressiveness.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to the maintenance of a strong 
immunosuppressive environment, supporting tumor progression and resistance to 
treatment. To date, the mechanisms that drive acquisition of these 
immunosuppressive features are still poorly defined. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is 
the rate-limiting enzyme that catabolizes free heme. It displays important 
cytoprotective, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant properties. A growing body of 
evidence suggests that HO-1 may also promote tumor development. Herein, we show 
that HO-1 is highly expressed in monocytic cells in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) once they differentiate into TAMs. Deletion of HO-1 in the myeloid 
compartment enhances the beneficial effects of a therapeutic antitumor vaccine 
by restoring CD8+ T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. We further show that 
induction of HO-1 plays a major role in monocyte education by tumor cells by 
modulating their transcriptional and epigenetic programs. These results identify 
HO-1 as a valuable therapeutic target to reprogram the TME and synergize with 
current cancer therapies to facilitate antitumor response.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in tumors and predominately 
show protumor M2-type fostering tumor progression. Specific depletion of TAMs is 
conceivably favorable for antitumor therapy. In this study, mannosylated mixed 
micelles (DAS-MMic) were developed to specifically deliver dasatinib (DAS) to 
eliminate TAMs for tumor immunotherapy. In vitro and in vivo results showed that 
DAS-MMic could effectively eradicate TAMs, decrease angiogenesis, reprogram the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and finally suppress tumor 
progression. These data suggest the potential of direct elimination of TAMs by 
DAS-MMic for tumor immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumour (WT) is the most common childhood renal tumour. 
Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a critical component of tumour 
microenvironments and contain two main subtypes, classically (M1) or 
alternatively (M2) activated macrophages. Evidence has revealed TAMs in 
predicting poor prognosis in some malignant tumours. However, the role of TAMs 
in WT is still unclear, and the relationship of different types of TAMs with 
prognosis has not been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the presence of two types of TAMs 
in WT and analyse the relationship of TAMs with prognosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Overall, 61 paediatric patients with WT underwent nephrectomy 
before any chemotherapy from April 2006 to March 2014. The tumour tissues were 
analysed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to 
explore the distribution of M1 and M2 macrophages in different stages. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis with regard to the relationship between the presence of 
TAMs and follow-up information was performed.
RESULTS: In the 61 patients (44 males and 17 females), there was a median age of 
19 months (IQR 13-35.5); 47 patients are still alive, 11 died, 3 were lost to 
follow-up. According to the National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS)-5 guidelines, the 
distribution of tumour stages was as follows: stage I, 27 patients; stage II, 18 
patients; and stage III, 16 patients. The Western blot analysis showed that the 
density of M1 and M2 macrophages in tumour tissues were significantly greater 
than that in adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed the proportion 
of patients with positive M1-type macrophages across different stages: stage I, 
66.7% (18/27); stage II, 44.4% (8/18); and stage III, 25% (4/16) (p = 0.027). 
The proportion of patients with positive M2-type macrophages across different 
stages: stage I, 25.9% (7/27); stage II, 55.6% (10/18); and stage III, 81.3% 
(13/16) (p = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that patients with high 
densities of M2-type macrophages had shorter overall survival time than those 
with low densities (log-rank test, p = 0.011).
DISCUSSION: TAMs play a pivotal comments in the tumour microenvironment and 
tumorigenesis. With the progression of clinical stage, M2 macrophage densities 
increased greatly, and M1 macrophage density decreased. M2 macrophages represent 
a poor prognosis and can be utilized as a new indicator in pathological 
examination.
CONCLUSION: There is a high density of TAMs in WT, and M2-type macrophage 
density increases with tumour progression and implies a poor prognosis.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are closely correlated with tumor 
occurrence, invasion, and metastasis. However, factors affecting the biological 
functions of TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) are incompletely understood. Here, 
we found that Wnt5a was mainly expressed on TAMs of tumor stroma but not on CRC 
cells. Subsequently, we found that Wnt5a+ TAMs facilitated tumor cell 
proliferation and migration, and recruited macrophages infiltration. 
Furthermore, Wnt5a knockdown impaired the pro-tumor roles of TAMs in vivo and in 
vitro. Mechanistically, the cancer-promoting roles of Wnt5a in TAMs depended on 
CaMKII-ERK pathway-mediated CCL2 secretion. Our data reveal the crucial role 
played by TAM-expressed Wnt5a in CRC tumorigenesis through paracrine secretion 
of CCL2. We first report the connection between Wnt5a/CaMKII/ERK/CCL2 axis and 
biological functions of TAMs in tumor microenvironment, indicating that Wnt5a 
may be a novel therapeutic target for CRC.

Metastasis is the primary cause of death for most cancer patients, in which 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are involved through several mechanisms. 
While hitherto there is still a lack of study on exclusive elimination of TAMs 
to inhibit metastasis due to the difficulties in specific targeting of TAMs, we 
construct an extra- and intracellular stepwise-responsive delivery system 
p-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid (PAMB)/doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve specific TAM 
depletion for the first time, thereby preventing tumor metastasis. Once 
accumulated into the tumor, PAMB/DOX would stepwise responsively (hypoxia and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsively) disintegrate to expose the 
TAM-targeting ligand and release DOX sequentially, which depletes TAMs 
effectively in vivo. Owing to the inhibition of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
degradation, neovascularization, and tumor invasion contributed by TAM 
depletion, lung metastasis was successfully inhibited. Furthermore, PAMB/DOX 
showed efficient inhibition against tumor growth as well as spontaneous 
metastasis formation when combined with additional chemotherapy, representing a 
safe and efficient nanoplatform to modulate the adverse tumor microenvironment 
via TAM elimination.

RNA interference (RNAi)-based immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has 
emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The transport 
of siRNA and small molecular agents from the tumor vasculature to a separate 
therapeutic target has been impeded by multiple physiological barriers, which 
has restricted the development of RNAi-based chemoimmunotherapy. A 
nanotechnology-based co-delivery system was superior in improving the 
co-localization of gene and drug in the same tumor cell, while a co-delivery 
system for chemoimmunotherapy was expected to realize xenotype cell-targeting, 
which means delivering immunotherapy agents and chemotherapy drugs to immune 
cells and tumor cells, respectively. A multilayer structure co-delivery system 
was outstanding in crossing these barriers and targeting different cells in 
tumor tissue. Herein, a "layer peeling" co-delivery system (CDMPR) was developed 
with co-loaded IKKβ-siRNA and doxorubicin (DOX), in which IKKβ-siRNA was used 
for RNAi-based tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization for 
immunotherapy and DOX was used for chemotherapy. A transwell assay in vitro and 
an immunofluorescence assay in Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mice indicated that CDMPR 
exhibited a pH-sensitive disassembly ability in tumor tissue, IKKβ-siRNA was 
precisely delivered to M2-type TAMs and DOX was internalized into tumor cells. 
An M2-type TAMs polarization ability study of CDMPR demonstrated that M2-type 
TAMs could be polarized to M1-type TAMs by CDMPR in vitro and in vivo. In 
Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mice, CDMPR exhibited improved antitumor efficiency with 
M2-type re-polarization ability by the precise delivery of IKKβ-siRNA and DOX to 
M2-type TAMs and tumor cells, respectively. Consequently, the combination of 
RNAi-based TAMs polarization and chemotherapy by the "layer peeling" co-delivery 
system would achieve an enhanced chemoimmunotherapy effect, which provides a 
novel strategy to improve cancer therapeutic effects.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute up to 50% of tumor bulk in 
glioblastoma (GBM) and play an important role in tumor maintenance and 
progression. The recently discovered differences between invading tumour 
periphery and hypoxic tumor core implies that macrophage biology is also 
distinct by location. This may provide further insight into the observed 
treatment resistance to immune modulation. We hypothesize that macrophage 
activation occurs through processes that are distinct in tumor periphery versus 
core. We therefore investigated regional differences in TAM recruitment and 
evolution in GBM by combining open source single cell and bulk gene expression 
data. We used single cell gene expression data from 4 glioblastomas (total of 
3589 cells) and 122 total bulk samples obtained from 10 different patients. Cell 
identity, ontogeny (bone-marrow derived macrophages-BMDM vs microglia), and 
macrophage activation state were inferred using verified gene expression 
signatures. We captured the spectrum of immune states using cell trajectory 
analysis with pseudotime ordering. In keeping with previous studies, TAMs 
carrying BMDM identity were more abundant in tumor bulk while microglia-derived 
TAMs dominated the tumor periphery across all macrophage activation states 
including pre-activation. We note that core TAMs evolve towards a 
pro-inflammatory state and identify a subpopulation of cells based on a gene 
program exhibiting strong, opposing correlation with Programmed cell Death-1 
(PD-1) signaling, which may correlate to their response to PD-1 inhibition. By 
contrast, peripheral TAMs evolve towards anti-inflammatory phenotype and 
contains a population of cells strongly associated with NFkB signaling. Our 
preliminary analysis suggests important regional differences in TAMs with regard 
to recruitment and evolution. We identify regionally distinct and potentially 
actionable cell subpopulations and advocate the need for a multi-targeted 
approach to GBM therapeutics.

The tumor-microenvironment contains large numbers of tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) which are largely M2 phenotypes and are involved in 
pro-tumorous functions. Targeting TAMs so as to manipulate them and to modify 
their functions could be a novel immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Such 
a strategy would involve targeting TAMs with short interfering RNA (siRNA) to 
modify their functions by silencing certain genes that are responsible for their 
M2 polarization. In this study, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation was used 
to target and deliver siRNA to TAMs. The LNP was mainly composed of a novel, 
pH-sensitive cationic lipid, referred to as the CL4H6 lipid, which had 
previously been optimized to target hepatocytes. The optimized siRNA-loaded 
CL4H6-LNPs were selectively and efficiently taken up and showed strong gene 
silencing activity in TAMs in a human tumor xenograft model in nude mice. 
Furthermore, an anti-tumor therapeutic response in the same tumor model was 
obtained by targeting TAMs using the optimized siRNA-loaded CL4H6-LNPs. The 
anti-tumor therapeutic response was obtained through the silencing of the signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and hypoxia inducible factor 
1 α (HIF-1α), which resulted in an increase in the level of infiltrated 
macrophage (CD11b+ cells) into the tumor-microenvironment (TME) as well as a 
tendency to increase the concentration of M1 macrophages (CD169+ cells). The 
treatment also resulted in reversing the pro-tumorous functions of TAMs -mainly 
angiogenesis and tumor cell activation-, as evidenced by a decrease in the 
related gene expression at the mRNA level. This research has promising clinical 
and pharmaceutical applications for achieving novel macrophage-based cancer 
immunotherapy.

Tumor-promoting inflammation is a hallmark of cancer and is highly associated 
with tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) are major drivers of tumor-promoting inflammation, but due to 
the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, the detailed regulatory mechanisms 
are still under investigation. Here, we investigated a novel role for 
transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in the development of tumor-promoting inflammation and 
recruitment of TAMs to gastric cancer (GC) tissues. When estimated by array 
comparative genomic hybridization and droplet digital PCR, the copy numbers of 
the TGM2 gene were amplified in 13.6% (14/103) of GC patients and positively 
associated with TGM2 expression. Gene set enrichment analysis of expression 
microarray data for GC samples with high or low TGM2 expression showed that 
increased TGM2 expression was associated with tumor-promoting inflammation in 
GC. In addition, the expression of TGM2 was correlated with the expression of 
markers for macrophages, neutrophils, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. 
Overexpression of TGM2 in GC cells augmented the IL-1β-induced secretion of 
macrophage-recruiting chemokines and NF-κB activation. TGM2 protein levels were 
associated with the expression levels of the macrophage marker CD163 in human GC 
tissue samples. Moreover, GC patients with high expression of TGM2 had a worse 
prognosis than those with low expression of TGM2. These results suggest TGM2 as 
a novel regulator of the tumor microenvironment of GC and provide a promising 
target for constraining tumor-promoting inflammation.

The tumor microenvironment is rich with immune-suppressive macrophages that are 
associated with cancer progression and resistance to immune checkpoint therapy. 
Using pre-treatment tumor biopsies complemented with single-cell RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq), we characterize intratumoral immune heterogeneity to unveil potential 
mechanisms of resistance to avelumab (anti-PD-L1). We identify a proinflammatory 
F480+MHCII+Ly6Clo macrophage population that is associated with response rather 
than resistance to avelumab. These macrophages are the primary source of the 
interferon-inducible chemokine Cxcl9, which facilitates the recruitment of 
protective Cxcr3+ T cells. Consequently, the efficacy of avelumab in mouse tumor 
models is dependent on Cxcr3 and Cxcl9, and baseline levels of Cxcl9 in patients 
treated with avelumab are associated with clinical response and overall 
survival. These data suggest that, within the broadly immune-suppressive 
macrophage compartment, a pro-inflammatory population exists that promotes 
responsiveness to PD-L1 blockade.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains one of the most common cancers in men. 
Macrophages are thought to be important regulators in cancers, and their 
potential involvement in prostate cancer should not be overlooked. Therefore, 
the association between macrophages and the pre-tumorous changes in prostate 
epithelium during aging deserves further investigation.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether macrophages would be recruited into 
the prostate epithelium that display pathological lesions commonly found during 
aging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostates of aging rats, with and without treatment with 
a combination of testosterone and estradiol, were examined for premalignant and 
malignant epithelial lesions. For comparison, prostates of castrated rats were 
also investigated.
RESULTS: Intraepithelial macrophages were found restricted to areas of 
premalignant and malignant lesions. An unprecedented interaction between 
macrophages and basal cells was observed in the aging pathological lesions. The 
intraepithelial macrophages were associated with autophagy, in contrast to those 
found after castration. In prostate lesions, the intraepithelial macrophages had 
TAM phenotype (CD68+/iNOS+/CD206+/ARG+), denoting a possible involvement in 
cancer progression. However, M2 macrophages (CD68+/CD163+) were recruited into 
the epithelium after castration, possibly to phagocytize cells undergoing 
apoptosis.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, macrophages were recruited into the 
prostate epithelium and presented diverse phenotypes and morphology, consistent 
with changes reflected in the hormonal environment. Macrophages with the TAM 
phenotype were found restricted to areas of premalignant and malignant lesions 
in aging prostates, denoting a possible involvement in cancer progression. In 
contrast, M2 macrophages were found in the regressed epithelium after 
castration.

We developed a STAT3 silencing siRNA to both tumor cells and M2 macrophages. The 
dual-targeting system prepared by electronic self-assembly was composed of folic 
acid-conjugated carboxymethyl chitosan for targeting and cationic chitosan 
derivatives for siRNA package. The effects of siRNA delivery was investigated in 
M2 macrophages and Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC). Due to the enhanced delivery 
efficiency, the dual-targeting delivery system exhibited a higher efficacy 
compared with non-targeting nanoparticles, resulting in a dramatically reduction 
of STAT3 expression in both cells, and a successful shift from M2 phenotypes 
(pro-tumor) to M1 phenotypes (anti-tumor) for macrophages. Additionally, the 
influence of the nanoparticles on LLC cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages was 
also investigated. The increased apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of 
LLC cells were observed. In vivo therapeutic effect was also evaluated in s.c. 
tumor models, tumor growth was effectively inhibited and the level of M2 
macrophages in tumor tissues was dramatically reduced.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related death in China. The lack of an effective treatment for this 
disease results in a high recurrence rate in patients who undergo radical tumor 
resection, and the 5-year survival rate of these patients remains low. Our 
previous studies demonstrated that Plasmodium infection provides a potent 
antitumor effect by inducing innate and adaptive immunity in a murine Lewis lung 
carcinoma (LLC) model.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of Plasmodium 
infection on hepatocellular carcinoma in mice, and various techniques for gene 
expression analysis were used to identify possible signal regulation mechanisms.
RESULTS: We found that Plasmodium infection efficiently inhibited tumor 
progression and prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, which served as a 
murine implanted hepatoma model. The inhibition of tumor progression by 
Plasmodium infection was related to suppression of tumor angiogenesis within the 
tumor tissue and decreased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). 
Further study demonstrated that matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) produced by 
TAMs contributed to tumor angiogenesis in the tumor tissue and that the 
parasite-induced reduction in MMP-9 expression in TAMs resulted in the 
suppression of tumor angiogenesis. A mechanistic study revealed that the 
Plasmodium-derived hemozoin (HZ) that accumulated in TAMs inhibited IGF-1 
signaling through the PI3-K and MAPK signaling pathways and thereby decreased 
the expression of MMP-9 in TAMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that this novel approach of inhibiting tumor 
angiogenesis by Plasmodium infection is of high importance for the development 
of new therapies for cancer patients. Video abstract.

PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been widely used for the 
clinical treatment of cancer. However, recent clinical trials have shown that 
only a small proportion of cancer patients respond to PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. 
The tumor immune microenvironment plays an important regulatory role in 
PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Macrophages are one of the most important immune cells 
in the tumor immune microenvironment. In this study, we found a high correlation 
between macrophage infiltration and PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer (GC) 
specimens. Further study revealed that infiltrated macrophages released the 
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-ɑ and IL-6, which induced PD-L1 expression in 
tumor cells. The release of TNF-ɑ and IL-6 activated the NF-kB and STAT3 
signaling pathway to regulate PD-L1 expression. TNF-α, p-65 and STAT3 expression 
in cancer patients has prognostic value in stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, 
infiltrated macrophages can also promote GC cell proliferation by inducing PD-L1 
expression in GC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that macrophages 
play a dual role in regulating the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. On the 
one hand, macrophages induce PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, helping tumor 
cells escape cytotoxic T cell killing; on the other hand, they can promote the 
proliferation of tumor cells by regulating the expression of PD-L1.

Interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are 
critical for glioblastoma progression. The TAMs represent up to 30% of the 
glioblastoma mass. The role of TAMs in tumor progression and in the mechanisms 
underlying tumor growth remain unclear. Using an in vitro model resembling the 
crosstalk between macrophages and glioblastoma cells, we show that 
glioblastoma-derived exosomes (GBex) reprogram M1 (mediate pro-inflammatory 
function) and M2 (mediate anti-inflammatory function) macrophages, converting M1 
into TAMs and augmenting pro-tumor functions of M2 macrophages. In turn, these 
GBex-reprogrammed TAMs, produce exosomes decorated by immunosuppressive and 
tumor-growth promoting proteins. TAM-derived exosomes disseminate these proteins 
in the tumor microenvironment (TME) promoting tumor cell migration and 
proliferation. Mechanisms underlying the promotion of glioblastoma growth 
involved Arginase-1+ exosomes produced by the reprogrammed TAMs. A selective 
Arginase-1 inhibitor, nor-NOHA reversed growth-promoting effects of Arginase-1 
carried by TAM-derived exosomes. The data suggest that GBex-reprogrammed 
Arginase-1+ TAMs emerge as a major source of exosomes promoting tumor growth and 
as a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma.

Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for multiple myeloma development. Tumor cells can 
stimulate angiogenesis by secreting vascular endothelial growth factor A 
(VEGFA), but we previously reported that tumor angiogenesis was not 
significantly reduced when VEGFA expression was inhibited in myeloma cells. 
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important components of the tumor 
microenvironment and have been reported to be involved in the regulation of 
angiogenesis. In this study, we performed in vitro macrophage coculture studies 
and studies with RPMI 8226 and TAMs cell-conditioned media to explore their 
effects on the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results showed that M2 macrophages and RPMI 
8226 cells could synergistically promote HUVEC proliferation, migration, and 
tube formation, and that VEGFA depletion in both cell types suppressed HUVEC 
tube formation ability. Conversely, M1 macrophages inhibited the tube formation 
in HUVECs. Mechanistically, M2 macrophage secretion of VEGFA may affect vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 signaling to regulate angiogenesis. In 
summary, our results suggest that macrophage clearance or inducing of 
transformation of M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages are potential treatment

The infiltration of immune cells is a hallmark of most forms of malignancy. It 
is well known that in Tumor Microenvironment (TME), monocytes undergo 
reprogramming process to differentiate into Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) 
(M2 macrophages). Interestingly, this reprogramming process depends on signals 
provided by tumors. Hence, tumors from several tissues are infiltrated by 
functionally distinct TAMs populations. Tumor Protein p53(TP53) plays a role in 
the regulation or progression of DNA damage and repair through multiple 
mechanisms of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Although, TP53 
acts as a physiological break for M2 macrophages polarization; the potential 
regulatory function of TP53 in the infiltration of macrophages is still unknown. 
We used the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) clinical data from 10,009 samples across 
30 types of cancer via the Tumor IMmune Estimation Tool (TIMER) 
(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) to investigate whether TP53 status has an 
important clinical outcome on macrophages infiltration in different cancer 
types. Our analysis of TCGA showed that Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV) 
patients with mutant TP53 had significantly higher macrophages infiltration than 
those with wild-type TP53 (P-value < 0.05) and poor prognosis associated. In 
contrast, Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients with wild-type TP53 had 
considerably higher macrophages infiltration than those with mutant TP53 
(P-value < 0.01) and poor clinical outcomes. Herein, our study sheds light on 
the novel clinical role of TP53 in macrophages infiltration in TME of OV and 
STAD patients. Furthermore, the modulation of TP53 and its co-regulators may 
serve as promising targets for OV and STAD patients.

Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) are relatively rare catecholamine-producing tumors 
derived from adrenal medulla. Tumor microenvironment (TME) including 
neoangiogenesis has been explored in many human neoplasms but not necessarily in 
PHEOs. Therefore, in this study, we examined tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (CD4 
and CD8), tumor associated macrophages (CD68 and CD163), sustentacular cells 
(S100p), and angiogenic markers (CD31 and areas of intratumoral hemorrhage) in 
39 cases of PHEOs in the quantitative fashion. We then compared the results with 
pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score (PASS), grading system for 
pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (GAPP) and the status of intra-tumoral 
catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes (TH, DDC, and PNMT) as well as their 
clinicopathological factors. Intratumoral CD8 (p = 0.0256), CD31 (p = 0.0400), 
and PNMT (p = 0.0498) status was significantly higher in PHEOs with PASS <4 than 
PASS ≧4. In addition, intratumoral CD8+ lymphocytes were also significantly more 
abundant in well-than moderately differentiated PHEO according to GAPP score (p 
= 0.0108) and inversely correlated with tumor size (p = 0.0257). Intratumoral 
CD68+ cells were significantly higher in PHEOs with regular or normal 
histological patterns than those not (p = 0.0370) and inversely correlated with 
tumor size (p = 0.0457). The status of CD163 was significantly positively 
correlated with that of CD8 positive cells (p = 0.0032). The proportion of 
intratumoral hemorrhage areas was significantly higher in PHEOs with PASS ≧4 (p 
= 0.0172). DDC immunoreactivity in tumor cells was significantly positively 
correlated with PASS score (p = 0.0356) and TH status was significantly higher 
in PHEOs harboring normal histological patterns (p = 0.0236) and cellular 
monotony (p = 0.0219) than those not. Results of our present study did 
demonstrate that abundant CD8+ and CD68+ cells could represent a histologically 
low-scored tumor. In particular, PHEOs with increased intratumoral hemorrhage 
should be considered rather malignant. In addition, abnormal 
catecholamine-producing status of tumor cells such as deficient PNMT and TH and 
increased DDC could also represent more aggressive PHEOs.

BACKGROUND: Tumor microenvironment is a complex and dynamic community, which 
plays a crucial role in tumor progression via the co-evolution of cancer cells 
and tumor stroma. Among them, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor 
neo-vessels are two key components in the tumor microenvironment during cancer 
invasion. In addition, programmed cell death ligand 1/programmed cell death 
ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) also plays an important role in tumorigenesis and 
development, and the clinical strategies to block PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could have 
great benefits for cancer patients. This study was aimed at analyzing the 
quantitative expression and prognostic significance of TAMs, tumor neo-vessels 
and PD-L1 in tumor microenvironment and exploring the relations between the 
expression of above components with the patients' prognosis of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Clinico-pathological data and surgical specimens of 92 patients with 
NSCLC were collected, and immunohistochemistry was used to stain the expression 
of TAMs, tumor neo-vessels and PD-L1 on tumor tissue and peri-tumor tissues. The 
inverted microscopy was used to take pictures and Image-pro Plus 6.0 software 
was used for quantitative analysis. The clinicopathological characteristics and 
overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: The median OS of 92 NSCLC cases was 22.5 month. The expression of TAMs, 
tumor neo-vessels and PD-L1 in tumor tissue and peri-tumor tissues were not 
statistically significant (P>0.05). According to the cutoff of above key three 
components in tumor microenvironment, all the cases could be classified into 
high, middle and low expression groups. The survival analysis demonstrated that 
the OS in high expression group of TAMs (P=0.016) and PD-L1 (P=0.002) was 
shorter than the other two groups, respectively, with statistical significance. 
The OS in high tumor neo vessels group was shorter than the other two groups. 
However, there was no statistical significance between these three group 
(P=0.626). Combined with above the three components, all the cases could be 
classified into low, middle and high density groups. The survival analysis 
demonstrated that the median OS of combined high density group was shorter than 
the other two groups (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis by Cox regression 
indicated that pathological type, TAMs and PD-L1 expression were the independent 
prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The key components of TAMs and PD-L1 in tumor microenvironment are 
closely related to the prognosis of NSCLC patients.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been considered as a major component of 
the tumor microenvironment. However, the crosstalk between M2-polarized 
tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) 
remains undetermined. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of 
M2-TAMs in ICC and the underlying mechanism. The in vitro assay demonstrated 
M2-TAMs promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ICC cells, resulting 
in enhanced cell invasion and metastasis ability. Moreover, M2-TAMs modulated 
the microenvironment of ICC by increasing the secretion of cytokines (GM-CSF, 
tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], ICAM-1, interleukin-6 [IL-6], etc) and 
chemokines (CCL1, CCL3, etc). In addition, p-AKT (Ser473) and p-PRAS40 (Thr246) 
were upregulated in ICC cells when cocultured with M2-TAMs or treated with 
M2-TAMs secreted core cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-α, ICAM-1, and IL-6). Consistently, 
AKT3 silencing (but not AKT1 silencing and AKT2 silencing) markedly inhibited 
phosphorylation of AKT and PRAS40 of ICC cells and inhibited the EMT process 
when cocultured with M2-TAMs. Taken together, the current data indicated that 
M2-TAMs promoted ICC cells EMT, partially through increasing secretion of 
cytokines and chemokines, thus modulating the microenvironment and activating 
the AKT3/PRAS40 signaling pathway.

Highly invasive and rapidly fatal, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been an 
insurmountable gulf since discovery. Innate immunity plays a vital role in 
anti-tumor response, among which macrophages contribute to an indispensable 
character. Here, we found that macrophage infiltration in SCLC reduced 
significantly in a stage-dependent manner, attributed to the decreased 
expression of CCL2, a potent chemoattractant for monocytes. Validated by 
ChIP-qPCR and MassArray methylation analysis, CCL2 expression was inhibited by 
EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in the enhancer regions and DNMT1-mediated DNA 
methylation in the promoter regions, the process of which could be reversed by 
small-molecular compounds, EPZ011989 and Decitabine. Direct cell-cell contact 
between SCLC cells and macrophages skewed the phenotype of macrophages to be 
more M1-like. Furthermore, in an ectopic engraft model of SCLC, disruption of 
EZH2/DNMT1 function using the combination treatment of EPZ011989 and Decitabine 
potently abrogated the inhibition of macrophage infiltration and thus suppressed 
tumor growth, the effect of which was impaired by CCL2 neutralization or 
macrophage depletion. Overall, this work provides new insights into the role of 
macrophages in SCLC and establishes a rationale for constructing novel 
therapeutic avenues for SCLC patients.

Immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy delivers promising clinical results in 
colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only a fraction of cancer patients develop 
durable responses. The tumor microenvironment (TME) negatively impacts tumor 
immunity and subsequently clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is a need to 
identify other checkpoint targets associated with the TME. Early-onset factors 
secreted by stromal cells as well as tumor cells often help recruit immune cells 
to the TME, among which are alarmins such as IL-33. The only known receptor for 
IL-33 is stimulation 2 (ST2). Here we demonstrated that high ST2 expression is 
associated with poor survival and is correlated with low CD8+ T cell 
cytotoxicity in CRC patients. ST2 is particularly expressed in tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs). In preclinical models of CRC, we demonstrated that 
ST2-expressing TAMs (ST2+ TAMs) were recruited into the tumor via CXCR3 
expression and exacerbated the immunosuppressive TME; and that combination of 
ST2 depletion using ST2-KO mice with anti-programmed death 1 treatment resulted 
in profound growth inhibition of CRC. Finally, using the IL-33trap fusion 
protein, we suppressed CRC tumor growth and decreased tumor-infiltrating ST2+ 
TAMs. Together, our findings suggest that ST2 could serve as a potential 
checkpoint target for CRC immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are immunosuppressive cells that 
contribute to impaired anti-cancer immunity. Iron plays a critical role in 
regulating macrophage function. However, it is still elusive whether it can 
drive the functional polarization of macrophages in the context of cancer and 
how tumor cells affect the iron-handing properties of TAM. In this study, using 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a study model, we aimed to explore the effect 
and mechanism of reduced ferrous iron in TAM.
METHODS: TAM from HCC patients and mouse HCC tissues were collected to analyze 
the level of ferrous iron. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess M1 or 
M2 signature genes of macrophages treated with iron chelators. A co-culture 
system was established to explore the iron competition between macrophages and 
HCC cells. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine the 
holo-transferrin uptake of macrophages. HCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) were enrolled to evaluate the prognostic value of transferrin receptor 
(TFRC) and its relevance to tumor-infiltrating M2 macrophages.
RESULTS: We revealed that ferrous iron in M2-like TAM is lower than that in 
M1-like TAM. In vitro analysis showed that loss of iron-induced 
immunosuppressive M2 polarization of mouse macrophages. Further experiments 
showed that TFRC, the primary receptor for transferrin-mediated iron uptake, was 
overexpressed on HCC cells but not TAM. Mechanistically, HCC cells competed with 
macrophages for iron to upregulate the expression of M2-related genes via 
induction of HIF-1α, thus contributing to M2-like TAM polarization. We further 
clarified the oncogenic role of TFRC in HCC patients by TCGA. TFRC is 
significantly increased in varieties of malignancies, including HCC, and HCC 
patients with high TFRC levels have considerably shortened overall survival. 
Also, TFRC is shown to be positively related to tumor-infiltrating M2 
macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we identified iron starvation through TFRC-mediated 
iron competition drives functional immunosuppressive polarization of TAM, 
providing new insight into the interconnection between iron metabolism and tumor 
immunity.

Immunostaining, Flow cytometry, respectively. In the current study, Our results 
indicated that thalidomide significantly inhibited tumor growth in the mouse 
model by inhibiting angiogenesis and promoting the necrosis of tumor cells in 
tumor tissues. Moreover, immunostaining and flow cytometry results demonstrated 
that M2-type tumor-associated macrophage accumulation and infiltration were 
profoundly inhibited upon treatment with thalidomide. In addition, thalidomide 
treatment also regulated cytokine production by inhibiting the production of 
angiogenesis-related cytokines, such as G-CSF, VEGF-B, VEGFR1, VEGFR3 and IL-10. 
In conclusion, our studies explored the antitumor effect of thalidomide in a 
breast tumor model and uncovered that thalidomide inhibited breast tumor growth 
by inhibiting angiogenesis as a result of reducing TAM accumulation and 
infiltration and inhibiting angiogenesis-related cytokine production.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) has 
dual-selectivity and hence is promising in cancer treatment. Since the scavenger 
receptor-A (SR-A) on TAMs can recognize polyanions, two molecular-weight sodium 
alginates (SA1, 41.2 kDa; SA2, 1231.5 kDa) were herein respectively conjugated 
with 1-[4-(2-aminoethyl) phenoxy] zinc (II) phthalocyanine (1) and two novel 
conjugates were obtained, characterized and evaluated for their TAMs-targeted 
PDT efficacy. The SA introduction makes 1 water-soluble, less aggregated and 
capable of emitting considerable fluorescence in water. Compared with 1, both 
conjugates, especially 1-SA1, can give higher selectivity and photocytotoxicity 
to SR-A-positive macrophages J774A.1 than SR-A-negative HepG2 cells. The in vivo 
biodistribution evaluation shows both conjugates can selectively accumulate at 
the tumor site and 1-SA1 owns higher tumor accumulation. 1-SA1 can achieve an 87 
% tumor inhibition rate without observable systemic toxicity. These results 
reveal the great potential of SA as a carrier for conjugating anti-tumor drugs 
and 1-SA1 for TAMs-targeted PDT.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy that has no 
effective treatment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDA employs a multitude 
of immune derangement strategies to protect PDA from immune elimination. 
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
immune suppression of the PDA TME; however, its underlying mechanisms remained 
largely unknown. Using primary patient samples, our studies showed that, in 
comparison with macrophages isolated from normal pancreatic tissues, the 
phagocytosis activity of the PDA TAMs was significantly reduced. We found that 
the expression of homeobox protein VentX, a master regulator of macrophage 
plasticity, was significantly decreased in the PDA TAMs. We demonstrated that 
VentX was required for phagocytosis and that restoration of VentX expression in 
PDA TAMs promoted phagocytosis through the regulation of the signaling cascades 
involved in the process. Using an ex vivo culture model of primary human PDA, we 
showed that VentX-modulated TAMs transformed the PDA TME from a protumor milieu 
to an antitumor microenvironment by rectifying differentiation, proliferation, 
and activation of PDA-infiltrating immune cells. Using NSG-PDX models of primary 
human PDAs, we showed that VentX-modulated TAMs exerted strong inhibition on PDA 
tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, our data revealed a central mechanism 
underlying immune evasion of PDA and a potential novel venue to improve PDA 
prognosis.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial role in the immune response 
to many malignancies, but the signaling pathways by which the glioma 
microenvironment cross-talk with TAMs are poorly understood. The aim of this 
study was to uncover the potential signaling pathways of the regulation of TAMs 
and identify candidate targets for therapeutic intervention of glioma through 
bioinformatics analysis.Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to download RNA-Seq data and microarray data of 
human glioma specimen. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CD68-high 
samples and CD68-low samples were sorted. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs 
was conducted. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were formed to identify 
the hub genes.The prognostic value of TAMs in glioma patients was confirmed. A 
total of 477 specific DEGs were sorted. The signaling pathway was identified in 
pathway enrichment and the DEGs showed prominent representations of immune 
response networks in glioma. The hub genes including C3, IL6, ITGB2, PTAFR, 
TIMP1 and VAMP8 were identified form the PPI network and they were all 
correlated positively with the expression of CD68 and showed the excellent 
prognostic value in glioma patients.TAMs can be used as a good prognostic 
indicator in glioma patients. By analyzing comprehensive bioinformatics data, we 
uncovered the underlying signaling pathway of the DEGs between glioma patients 
with high and low expression level of CD68. Furthermore, the 6 hub genes 
identified were closely associated with TAMs in glioma microenvironment and need 
further investigation.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which generally exhibit an M2-like 
phenotype, play a critical role in tumor development. Triptolide exerts a unique 
bioactive spectrum of anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to 
determine whether triptolide has any effect on the activation of TAMs and the 
production of tumor-promoting mediators. ICR-1 mice with azoxymethane/dextran 
sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colon tumors and BALB/c mice co-inoculated with 
4T1 cells and M2-polarized RAW264.7 cells were used to examine whether the 
inhibitory effect of triptolide on tumor progression was mediated by the 
targeting of TAMs. Real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and 
flow cytometry assays were performed to determine the expression of cell surface 
markers and cytokine production. The results showed that triptolide inhibited 
macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype and abolished M2 
macrophage-mediated tumor progression. Furthermore, triptolide inhibited the 
expression of M2 markers, such as CD206, Arginase 1, and CD204, and inhibited 
the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus our study indicated that 
triptolide selectively inhibited the functions of M2-polarized macrophages and 
TAMs, and this inhibitory effect of triptolide on TAM viability, 
differentiation, and cytokine production might elucidate the major mechanisms 
underlying its antitumor activity. Our findings provide important information 
for the potential clinical application of triptolide in cancer therapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were a major component of tumor, which 
comprised up to 50% of tumor mass, and correlated with poor prognosis in more 
than 80% of cases. TAMs were resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and 
radiation could further activate TAMs to promote tumor progression. Herein, we 
explored a kind of Bi-based mesoporous upconversion nanophosphor (UCNP) loaded 
with doxorubicin (UCNP-DOX) to elicit immunogenic tumor cell death and 
repolarize TAMs to an antitumor M1-like type for strengthening the 
tumor-specific antitumor immune effects of X-ray radiotherapy. The 
repolarization effect of UCNP-DOX with X-ray was confirmed in THP-1 cell line, 
in vivo mouse model, and hydrothorax of a non-small-cell lung carcinoma patient. 
Moreover, the UCNP-DOX and X-ray radiation could elicit immunogenic tumor 
necrosis, presenting more tumor antigens for tumor-specific immune response. In 
a cell co-incubation system, activated macrophages could significantly inhibit 
cancer colony formation, migration, and invasion. After treatment, xenografted 
tumor in mice was also found to be significantly regressed and presented 
substantial CD8-positive T cells. This study opens the door to further enhance 
the abscopal effects and inhibit the metastasis in radiotherapy.

Chemotherapy is commonly used as a major therapeutic option for breast cancer 
treatment, but its efficacy is often diminished by disruption of patient's 
anti-tumor immunity. Chemotherapy-generated tumor cell debris could hijack 
accumulated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), provoking tumor recurrence. 
Therefore, reprogramming TAMs to acquire an immunocompetent phenotype is a 
promising strategy to potentiate therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we 
analyzed the proportion of immune cells in the breast cancer patients who 
received chemotherapy. To validate our findings in vivo, we used a syngeneic 
murine breast cancer (4T1) model. Chemotherapy generates an immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. Here, we show that phagocytic 
engulfment of tumor cell debris by TAMs reduces chemotherapeutic efficacy in a 
4T1 breast cancer model. Specifically, the engulfment of tumor cell debris by 
macrophages reduced M1-like polarization through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 
upregulation. Conversely, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of HO-1 in TAMs 
restored the M1-like polarization. Our results demonstrate that tumor cell 
debris-induced HO-1 expression in macrophages regulates their polarization. 
Inhibition of HO-1 overexpression in TAMs may provoke a robust anti-tumor immune 
response, thereby potentiating the efficacy of chemotherapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play central roles in the regulation of 
tumor growth. TAMs can be differentiated into M1 and M2 types, which are 
responsible for the inhibition and growth of tumor tissues, respectively. 
Recognition of M2-TAMs is significant for the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, 
which is however severely limited due to the deficiency of selective and 
sensitive photoelectrochemical sensors. In this work, using Ce doped SnO2/SnS2 
nano heterostructure as the highly sensitive platform, a photoelectrochemical 
sensor enabling the recognition of M2-TAMs was fabricated for the first time. By 
the decoration of CD163 antibody on the platform, the ultrasensitive 
photoelectrochemical sensor can selectively detect the CD163 protein on the 
surface of M2-TAMs. To our best knowledge, this is the first demonstration for 
recognition of M2-TAMs using photoelectrochemical method. The fabricated 
cytosensor has ultra-sensitive photocurrent response, applicable biological 
compatibility, high selectivity and relatively wide linear sensing range 
(5 × 101 to 1 × 105 cells/ml) with a low detection limit (50 cells/ml) for the 
detection of M2-TAMS. This kind of PEC cytosensor would provide a novel analysis 
and detection strategy for M2-TAMs.

Plastic polarization of macrophage is involved in tumorigenesis. M1-polarized 
macrophage mediates rapid inflammation, entity clearance and may also cause 
inflammation-induced mutagenesis. M2-polarized macrophage inhibits rapid 
inflammation but can promote tumour aggravation. ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated 
fatty acid (PUFA)-derived metabolites show a strong anti-inflammatory effect 
because they can skew macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. However, their role 
in tumour promotive M2 macrophage is still unknown. Resolvin D1 and D2 (RvD1 and 
RvD2) are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived docosanoids converted by 
15-lipoxygenase then 5-lipoxygenase successively. We found that although dietary 
DHA can inhibit prostate cancer in vivo, neither DHA (10 μmol/L) nor RvD 
(100 nmol/L) can directly inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in 
vitro. Unexpectedly, in a cancer cell-macrophage co-culture system, both DHA and 
RvD significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation. RvD1 and RvD2 inhibited 
tumour-associated macrophage (TAM or M2d) polarization. Meanwhile, RvD1 and RvD2 
also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting LPS-interferon 
(IFN)-γ-induced M1 polarization as well as promoting interleukin-4 
(IL-4)-mediated M2a polarization. These differential polarization processes were 
mediated, at least in part, by protein kinase A. These results suggest that 
regulation of macrophage polarization using RvDs may be a potential therapeutic 
approach in the management of prostate cancer.

Heterotypic interactions between tumor cells and macrophages can enable tumor 
progression and hold potential for the development of therapeutic interventions. 
However, the communication between tumors and macrophages and its mechanism are 
poorly understood. Here, we find that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) from 
tumor-bearing mice have high amounts of lipid as compared to macrophages from 
tumor-free mice. TAM also present high lipid content in clinical human gastric 
cancer patients. Functionally, TAM with high lipid levels are characterized by 
polarized M2-like profiling, and exhibit decreased phagocytic potency and 
upregulated programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, blocking anti-tumor T 
cell responses to support their immunosuppressive function. Mechanistically, 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identifies the 
specific PI3K pathway enriched within lipid-laid TAM. Lipid accumulation in TAM 
is mainly caused by increased uptake of extracellular lipids from tumor cells, 
which leads to the upregulated expression of gamma isoform of phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K-γ) polarizing TAM to M2-like profiling. Correspondingly, a 
preclinical gastric cancer model is used to show pharmacological targeting of 
PI3K-γ in high-lipid TAM with a selective inhibitor, IPI549. IPI549 restores the 
functional activity of macrophages and substantially enhances the phagocytosis 
activity and promotes cytotoxic-T-cell-mediated tumor regression. Collectively, 
this symbiotic tumor-macrophage interplay provides a potential therapeutic 
target for gastric cancer patients through targeting PI3K-γ in lipid-laden TAM.

The progression of cancer is strongly influenced by the crosstalk between cancer 
cells and immune cells. Immune cells can have both pro- and anti-tumor functions 
depending on the signals present in the environment. A significant proportion of 
the immune compartment of most solid tumors consists of tumor-associated 
macrophages. Although their abundance has been associated with poor prognosis in 
many solid tumor types, the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells influence 
macrophage phenotype and function are largely unknown. In this chapter, we 
provide a detailed description of in vitro assays to study the impact of cancer 
cells on macrophages. We provide protocols to obtain macrophages from murine 
bone marrow and human peripheral blood, and to expose these macrophages to 
cancer cell-derived secreted molecules using conditioned medium from cancer 
cells. We describe several assays to assess cancer cell-induced polarization of 
macrophages. This experimental set-up can be utilized to gain molecular insights 
into how cancer cells influence macrophages.

CMV has been proposed to play a role in cancer progression and invasiveness. 
However, CMV has been increasingly studied as a cancer vaccine vector, and 
multiple groups, including ours, have reported that the virus can drive 
antitumor immunity in certain models. Our previous work revealed that 
intratumoral injections of wild-type murine CMV (MCMV) into B16-F0 melanomas 
caused tumor growth delay in part by using a viral chemokine to recruit 
macrophages that were subsequently infected. We now show that MCMV acts as a 
STING agonist in the tumor. MCMV infection of tumors in STING-deficient mice 
resulted in normal recruitment of macrophages to the tumor, but poor recruitment 
of CD8+ T cells, reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, 
and no delay in tumor growth. In vitro, expression of type I IFN was dependent 
on both STING and the type I IFNR. Moreover, type I IFN alone was sufficient to 
induce cytokine and chemokine production by macrophages and B16 tumor cells, 
suggesting that the major role for STING activation was to produce type I IFN. 
Critically, viral infection of wild-type macrophages alone was sufficient to 
restore tumor growth delay in STING-deficient animals. Overall, these data show 
that MCMV infection and sensing in tumor-associated macrophages through STING 
signaling is sufficient to promote antitumor immune responses in the B16-F0 
melanoma model.

The progress of antitumor immunotherapy is usually limited by tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) that account for the highest proportion of immunosuppressive 
cells in the tumor microenvironment, and the TAMs can also be reversed by 
modulating the M2-like phenotype. Herein, a biomimetic polymer magnetic 
nanocarrier is developed with selectively targeting and polarizing TAMs for 
potentiating immunotherapy of breast cancer. This nanocarrier PLGA-ION-R837 @ M 
(PIR @ M) is achieved, first, by the fabrication of magnetic polymer 
nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating Fe3 O4 NPs and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) 
agonist imiquimod (R837) and, second, by the coating of the lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)- treated macrophage membranes on the surface of the NPs for targeting 
TAMs. The intracellular uptake of the PIR @ M can greatly polarize TAMs from M2 
to antitumor M1 phenotype with the synergy of Fe3 O4 NPs and R837. The relevant 
mechanism of the polarization is deeply studied through analyzing the mRNA 
expression of the signaling pathways. Different from previous reports, the 
polarization is ascribed to the fact that Fe3 O4 NPs mainly activate the IRF5 
signaling pathway via iron ions instead of the reactive oxygen species-induced 
NF-κB signaling pathway. The anticancer effect can be effectively enhanced 
through potentiating immunotherapy by the polarization of the TAMs in the 
combination of Fe3 O4 NPs and R837.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and metastasis, and are 
closely related with poor prognosis of cancers. Therefore, TAMs have been an 
attractive target in cancer therapy. This study investigated whether the root 
bark of Morus alba L. (MA) regulates TAMs. Methylene chloride extract of MA 
(MEMA) decreased the migration of RAW264.7 cells and THP-1 macrophages toward 
cancer cells via inhibition of focal adhesion kinase and Src activity. In 
addition, MEMA inhibited the phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated secretion of 
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from cancer cells, leading to the decreased 
chemotaxis of macrophages. Finally, MEMA-suppressed M2 macrophage polarization 
induced by interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 or IL-6. MEMA downregulated the mRNA 
expression of M2 macrophage markers and decreased the phosphorylation of signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 and STAT3 in RAW264.7 cells. 
Suppression of M2 polarization of macrophages by MEMA resulted in the reduced 
migration of Lewis lung carcinoma cells when the conditioned media from RAW264.7 
cells was used as a chemoattractant. Taken together, our results demonstrate 
that MEMA regulates TAMs by blocking the recruitment of macrophages into tumor 
microenvironments and by inhibiting M2 polarization of macrophages.

Simultaneously targeted treatment of tumor cells and their surrounding 
growth-supporting immune cells is a promising strategy to reshape 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and potentiate host innate and 
adaptive antitumor immune responses. Methods: We designed a series of 
melittin-(RADA)n hybrid peptide sequences with varying self-assembling motifs of 
RADA and screened out a melittin-(RADA)6 peptide that has an optimal 
gel-formation ability and in vitro antitumor activity. Results: The formed 
melittin-(RADA)6 (MR52) hydrogel scaffold could be loaded with a specific 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) inhibitor, KN93, originally 
found to have both direct tumoricidal activity and macrophages-reprogramming 
ability, for potent immunotherapy against melanoma and hepatoma ascites in mice 
models. Our MR52 hydrogel has an interweaving nanofiber-like structure, 
possesses direct antitumor and controlled drug release properties, and promotes 
the enhanced intracellular uptake of loaded cargo. Compared to free KN93, the 
MR52-KN93 hydrogel (MRK) improved the killing effects and levels of immunogenic 
cell death (ICD) on tumor cells significantly. Due to the dual role of KN93, the 
injection of the MRK hydrogel retarded the growth of subcutaneous melanoma 
tumors dramatically and resulted in a high number of mature dendritic cells of 
draining lymph nodes, significantly enhancing the portion of cytotoxic T cells 
and reduced number of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumors. 
Using a mouse model of malignant ascites (MAs), where traditional therapy was 
ineffective, we demonstrated that the MRK hydrogel treatment offered a 
significantly prolonged survival compared to controls. Following treatment with 
the MRK hydrogel, macrophages had elevated programmed cell death protein 
ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, promising follow-up combined anti-PD-1 therapy that 
confers a cure rate of approximately 30% against MAs in mice models. Conclusion: 
Thus, the MRK hydrogel may serve as a prospective platform for antitumor 
applications.

We previously revealed the crucial roles of a chemokine, CX3CL1, and its 
receptor, CX3CR1, in skin wound healing. Although repeated wounds frequently 
develop into skin cancer, the roles of CX3CL1 in skin carcinogenesis remain 
elusive. Here, we proved that CX3CL1 protein expression and CX3CR1+ macrophages 
were observed in human skin cancer tissues. Similarly, we observed the 
enhancement of CX3CL1 expression and the abundant accumulation of CX3CR1+ 
tumor-associated macrophages with M2-like phenotypes in the skin carcinogenesis 
process induced by the combined treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene 
and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In this mouse skin carcinogenesis 
process, CX3CR1+ tumor-associated macrophages exhibited M2-like phenotypes with 
the expression of Wnt3a and angiogenic molecules including VEGF and matrix 
metalloproteinase 9. Compared with wild-type mice, CX3CR1-deficient mice showed 
fewer numbers of skin tumors with a lower incidence. Concomitantly, 
M2-macrophage numbers and neovascularization were reduced with the depressed 
expression of angiogenic factors and Wnt3a. Thus, the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis can 
crucially contribute to skin carcinogenesis by regulating the accumulation and 
functions of tumor-associated macrophages. Thus, this axis can be a good target 
for preventing and/or treating skin cancers.

Chondrosarcomas (CHS) are malignant cartilaginous neoplasms with diverse 
morphological features, characterized by resistance to chemo- and radiation 
therapies. In this study, we investigated the role of tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM)s in tumor tissues from CHS patients by immunohistochemistry. 
Three-dimensional organotypic co-cultures were set up in order to evaluate the 
contribution of primary human CHS cells in driving an M2-like phenotype in 
monocyte-derived primary macrophages, and the capability of macrophages to 
promote growth and/or invasiveness of CHS cells. Finally, with an in vivo model 
of primary CHS cells engrafted in nude mice, we tested the ability of a potent 
peptide inhibitor of cell migration (Ac-d-Tyr-d-Arg-Aib-d-Arg-NH2, denoted RI-3) 
to reduce recruitment and infiltration of monocytes into CHS neoplastic lesions. 
We found a significant correlation between alternatively activated M2 
macrophages and intratumor microvessel density in both conventional and 
dedifferentiated CHS human tissues, suggesting a link between TAM abundance and 
vascularization in CHS. In 3D and non-contact cu-culture models, soluble factors 
produced by CHS induced a M2-like phenotype in macrophages that, in turn, 
increased motility, invasion and matrix spreading of CHS cells. Finally, we 
present evidence that RI-3 successfully prevent both recruitment and 
infiltration of monocytes into CHS tissues, in nude mice.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are primarily of the M2 type that facilitates 
tumor growth, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Therefore, repolarizing the 
TAMs to the pro-inflammatory M1 type is a promising therapeutic strategy against 
cancer. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists like CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG 
ODNs) can induce anti-tumor macrophages, however, their applications in vivo are 
limited by the lack of effective delivery approaches. Naked CpG ODNs fail to 
penetrate cell membranes and are easily cleared by nucleases, which can 
potentially trigger an inflammatory response in serum by systemic 
administration. Nanoparticles can deliver TLR agonists to the target TAMs 
following systemic administration and selectively accumulate in tumors and 
macrophages, and eventually trigger TLR signaling and M1 polarization. In this 
study, we developed a nanoparticle vector for the targeted delivery of CpG ODNs 
to M2 type TAMs by encapsulating the CpG ODNs inside human ferritin heavy chain 
(rHF) nanocages surface modified with a murine M2 macrophage-targeting peptide 
M2pep. These M2pep-rHF-CpG nanoparticles repolarized M2 TAMs to the M1 type and 
inhibited tumor growth in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice after intravenous injection. 
Furthermore, M2pep-rHF-CpG also reversed the phenotype of cultured human 
macrophages in vitro. Interestingly, the empty M2pep-rHF nanoparticles lacking 
CpG ODNs also exhibited anti-tumor ability. Taken together, M2pep-rHF 
nanoparticles offer a novel anti-cancer therapeutic strategy via targeted 
delivery of CpG ODNs to M2 type TAMs, and M2pep-rHF-CpG or M2pep-rHF 
nanoparticles may become promising medicines for tumor immunotherapy.

Paediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs) account for the most brain tumour-related 
deaths in children and have a median survival of 12-15 months. One promising 
avenue of research is the development of novel therapies targeting the 
properties of non-neoplastic cell-types within the tumour such as tumour 
associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are immunosuppressive and promote tumour 
malignancy in adult HGG; however, in paediatric medulloblastoma, TAMs exhibit 
anti-tumour properties. Much is known about TAMs in adult HGG, yet little is 
known about them in the paediatric setting. This raises the question of whether 
paediatric HGGs possess a distinct constituency of TAMs because of their unique 
genetic landscapes. Using human paediatric HGG tissue samples and murine models 
of paediatric HGG, we demonstrate diffuse midline gliomas possess a greater 
inflammatory gene expression profile compared to hemispheric paediatric HGGs. We 
also show despite possessing sparse T-cell infiltration, human paediatric HGGs 
possess high infiltration of IBA1+ TAMs. CD31, PDGFRβ, and PDGFB all strongly 
correlate with IBA1+ TAM infiltration. To investigate the TAM population, we 
used the RCAS/tv-a system to recapitulate paediatric HGG in newborn 
immunocompetent mice. Tumours are induced in Nestin-positive brain cells by 
PDGFA or PDGFB overexpression with Cdkn2a or Tp53 co-mutations. Tumours driven 
by PDGFB have a significantly lower median survival compared to PDGFA-driven 
tumours and have increased TAM infiltration. NanoString and quantitative PCR 
analysis indicates PDGFB-driven tumours have a highly inflammatory 
microenvironment characterized by high chemokine expression. In vitro bone 
marrow-derived monocyte and microglial cultures demonstrate bone marrow-derived 
monocytes are most responsible for the production of inflammatory signals in the 
tumour microenvironment in response to PDGFB stimulation. Lastly, using knockout 
mice deficient for individual chemokines, we demonstrate the feasibility of 
reducing TAM infiltration and prolonging survival in both PDGFA and PDGFB-driven 
tumours. We identify CCL3 as a potential key chemokine in these processes in 
both humans and mice. Together, these studies provide evidence for the potent 
inflammatory effects PDGFB has in paediatric HGGs.

Immune infiltration is associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. However, 
previous studies have not accounted for the functional diversity of the cells 
involved in the immune response. We conducted a comprehensive comparative 
analysis of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in metastatic and non-metastatic 
osteosarcoma tissues based on a deconvolution algorithm (CIBERSORT). Twenty-two 
immune cell subsets were evaluated for their association with the presence or 
absence of metastasis in osteosarcoma patients. A lack of monocytes was 
associated with osteosarcoma metastasis; however, the levels of M1 macrophages, 
M2 macrophages and other immune cell subsets did not differ between the 
metastatic and non-metastatic groups. Additionally, a higher proportion of 
monocytes was associated with a better prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. 
Animal experiments demonstrated that the number of metastatic nodules was higher 
in mice lacking patrolling monocytes than in control mice. Our data indicated 
that the cellular composition of the immune infiltrate may subtly differ among 
osteosarcoma patients, and that patrolling monocytes inhibit osteosarcoma 
metastasis to the lungs of mice. Thus, the composition of the immune infiltrate 
and the level of patrolling monocytes may be important determinants of whether 
metastasis occurs in osteosarcoma patients.

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecologic 
cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play 
an immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor 
growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in ovarian cancer. Therefore, targeting 
TAMs in patients with ovarian cancer is an appealing strategy; however, all 
trials to date have failed. To improve the efficacy of this approach, we sought 
to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the role of TAMs in ovarian cancer. We 
found that the developmental transcription factor GATA3 was highly expressed in 
HGSOC cell lines but not in the fallopian tube, which is the main origin of 
HGSOC. GATA3 expression was associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC patients 
(P < .05) and was found to promote proliferation and migration in HGSOC cell 
lines. GATA3 was released abundantly from TAM cells via exosomes and contributed 
to tumor growth in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, GATA3 acted as a 
regulator for macrophage polarization and interactions between TAMs and HGSOC to 
support proliferation, motility, and cisplatin chemoresistance in mutant TP53 
HGSOC cell lines. Furthermore, GATA3 played a critical role in the interactions 
between TAMs and mutant TP53 HGSOC to promote angiogenesis and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition with epigenetic regulation. Targeting GATA3 
using GATA3siRNA in TAMs impeded GATA3-driven proliferation, migration, 
cisplatin chemoresistance, and angiogenesis in mutant TP53 HGSOC cell lines. Our 
findings indicate that GATA3 plays a novel role in immunoediting of HGSOC and 
demonstrate that GATA3 may serve as a prognostic marker for HGSOC and a 
promising target in the treatment of HGSOC.

Three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopy can be used to understand and improve 
the delivery of nanomedicine. However, this approach cannot be performed for 
analyzing liposomes in tissues because the processing step to make tissues 
transparent for imaging typically removes the lipids. Here, we developed a tag, 
termed REMNANT, that enables 3D imaging of organic materials in biological 
tissues. We demonstrated the utility of this tag for the 3D mapping of liposomes 
in intact tissues. We also showed that the tag is able to monitor the release of 
entrapped therapeutic agents. We found that liposomes release their cargo 
>100-fold faster in tissues in vivo than in conventional in vitro assays. This 
allowed us to design a liposomal formulation with enhanced ability to kill tumor 
associated macrophages. Our development opens up new opportunities for studying 
the chemical properties and pharmacodynamics of administered organic materials 
in an intact biological environment. This approach provides insight into the in 
vivo behavior of degradable materials, where the newly discovered information 
can guide the engineering of the next generation of imaging and therapeutic 
agents.

BACKGROUND: Given poor prognosis and the lack of efficient therapy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy has emerged as an increasingly important 
role. However, there were few reports on the correlation between immune-related 
genes and HCC. The purpose of this study is to construct a novel immune-related 
gene-based prognostic signature for HCC and to explore the potential mechanisms.
METHODS: We organized expression data of 374 HCC samples and 50 nontumor samples 
from TCGA database. A robust signature was constructed by Cox regression 
analysis based on the immune-related genes, which were filtered by differential 
genes analysis and Cox regression analysis. Then, the correlation analysis 
between the signature and clinical characteristics was conducted. And the 
signature was validated in ICGC database. Furthermore, the relationships between 
immune cell infiltration and the signature were explored by bioinformatics 
analysis.
RESULTS: Seven genes-based model (Risk score = BIRC5 * 0.0238 + FOS * 
0.0055 + DKK1 * 0.0085 + FGF13 * 0.3432 + IL11 * 0.0135 + IL17D * 0.0878 + SPP1 
* 0.0003) was constructed eventually and it was proved to be an independent 
prognostic factor for HCC patients. The signature-calculated risk scores were 
shown to be positively correlated with the infiltration of these five immune 
cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, CD8+T, dendritic, and B cells. And 
the results suggested that high amplication of BIRC5, FGF13, IL11, IL17D, and 
SPP1 were more likely correlated with immune cell infiltration. Finally, PPI 
network, TFs-based regulatory network and gene enrichment plots were performed 
to show potential molecular mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: We construct a robust immune-related gene-based prognostic signature 
with seven genes and explore potential mechanisms about it, which may contribute 
to the immunotherapy research for HCC.

Targeting Mitochondria in Tumor-Associated Macrophages using a 
Dendrimer-Conjugated TSPO Ligand that Stimulates Antitumor Signaling in 
Glioblastoma.

Sharma A, Liaw K, Sharma R, Thomas AG, Slusher BS, Kannan S, Kannan RM.

Mitochondria mediate critical cellular processes, including proliferation, 
apoptosis, and immune responses; as such, their dysfunction is pathogenic in 
many neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In glioblastoma, targeted delivery 
of mitochondria-focused anticancer therapies has failed to translate into 
clinical success due to the nonspecific cellular localization, heterogeneity of 
receptor expression across patients, poor transport across biological barriers 
to reach the brain, tumor, and mitochondria, and systemic side effects. 
Strategies that can overcome brain and solid tumor barriers and selectively 
target mitochondria within specific cell types may lead to improvements in 
glioblastoma treatment. Developments in dendrimer-mediated nanomedicines have 
shown promise targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in glioblastoma, 
following systemic administration. Here, we present a novel dendrimer conjugated 
to the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) ligand 
5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-α]pyrimidin-3-ylacetamide (DPA). We developed a 
clickable DPA for conjugation on the dendrimer surface and demonstrated in vitro 
that the dendrimer-DPA conjugate (D-DPA) significantly increases dendrimer 
colocalization with mitochondria. Compared to free TSPO ligand PK11195, D-DPA 
stimulates greater antitumor immune signaling. In vivo, we show that D-DPA 
targets mitochondria specifically within TAMs following systemic administration. 
Our results demonstrate that dendrimers can achieve TAM-specific targeting in 
glioblastoma and can be further modified to target specific intracellular 
compartments for organelle-specific drug delivery.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a major portion of 
the leukocyte infiltrate found in breast cancer (BC). BC cells may reprogram 
TAMs in a pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive sense. We previously showed that 
high expression of the ID4 protein in triple-negative BC cells leads to the 
induction of a proangiogenic program in TAMs also through the downregulation of 
miR-107. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the ID4 protein in 
TAMs.
METHODS: Human macrophages obtained from peripheral blood-derived monocytes 
(PBDM) and mouse RAW264.7 cells were used as macrophage experimental systems. 
ID4-correlated mRNAs of the TCGA and E-GEOD-18295 datasets were analyzed.
RESULTS: We observed that BC cells determine a paracrine induction of ID4 
expression and activation of the ID4 promoter in neighboring macrophages. 
Interestingly, ID4 expression is higher in macrophages associated with invasive 
tumor cells compared to general TAMs, and ID4-correlated mRNAs are involved in 
various pathways that were previously reported as relevant for TAM functions. 
Selective depletion of ID4 expression in macrophages enabled validation of the 
ability of ID4 to control the expression of YAP1 and of its downstream targets 
CTGF and CYR61.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results show that activation of ID4 expression in 
TAMs is observed as a consequence of BC cell paracrine activity and could 
participate in macrophage reprogramming in BC.

FBXW7 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate oncoprotein degradation via 
the ubiquitin-proteasome system in cancer cells, effectively inhibiting the 
growth and survival of tumor cells. However, little is known about the functions 
of FBXW7 in macrophages and the tumor immune microenvironment. In this study, we 
find that FBXW7 suppresses M2-like tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) 
polarization to limit tumor progression. We identified a significant increase in 
the proportion of M2-like TAMs and aggravated tumor growth in mice with myeloid 
FBXW7 deficiency by subcutaneous inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma cells 
(LLCs). When stimulated with LLCs supernatant in vitro, FBXW7-knockout 
macrophages displayed increased M2 macrophage polarization and enhanced ability 
of supporting cancer cells growth. In mechanism, we confirmed that FBXW7 
inhibited M2-like TAM polarization by mediating c-Myc degradation via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings highlight the role of FBXW7 in 
M2-like TAM polarization and provide new insights into the potential targets for 
cancer immunotherapies.

Background: Among the many immunosuppressive cells in the tumor 
microenvironment, tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs) are well known to 
contribute to tumor development. TAMs can be conditioned (polarized) to 
transition between classical M1-like macrophages, or alternatively to M2-like 
macrophages. Both are regulated by signaling molecules in the microenvironment. 
M1-like TAMs can secrete classic inflammatory cytokines that kill tumors by 
promoting tumor cell necrosis and immune cell infiltration into the tumor 
microenvironment. In contrast, M2-like TAMs exhibit powerful tumor-promoting 
functions, including degradation of tumor extracellular matrix, destruction of 
basement membrane, promotion of angiogenesis, and recruitment of 
immunosuppressor cells, all of which further promote tumor progression and 
distal metastasis. Therefore, remodeling the tumor microenvironment by reversing 
the TAM phenotype will be favorable for tumor therapy, especially immunotherapy. 
Methods: PLGA nanoparticles encapsulating baicalin and melanoma antigen Hgp 
peptide fragment 25-33 were fabricated using the ultrasonic double-emulsion 
technique. The nanoparticles were further loaded with CpG fragments and used 
conjugated M2pep and α-pep peptides on their surfaces to produce novel 
nano-complexes. The capability to target M2-like TAMs and anti-tumor 
immunotherapy effects of nano-complexes were evaluated by flow cytometry and 
confocal microscopy in vitro. We also investigated the survival and 
histopathology of murine melanoma models administrated with different 
nanocomplexes. Improvements in the tumor microenvironment for immune attack of 
melanoma-bearing mice were also assessed. Results: The nano-complexes were 
effectively ingested by M2-like TAMs in vitro and in vivo, and the acidic 
lysosomal environment triggered the disintegration of polydopamine from the 
nanoparticle surface, which resulted in the release of the payloads. The 
released CpG played an important role in transforming the M2-like TAMs into the 
M1-like phenotype that further secreted inflammatory cytokines. The reversal of 
TAM released cytokines and gradually suppressed tumor angiogenesis, permitting 
the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the activated TAMs also 
presented antigen to T cells, which further stimulated the antitumor immune 
response that inhibited tumor metastasis. Activated T cells released cytokines, 
which stimulated NK cell infiltration and directly resulted in killing tumor 
cells. The baicalin released by M1-like TAMs also killed tumor cells. 
Conclusion: The nano-complexes facilitated baicalin, antigen, and 
immunostimulant delivery to M2-like TAMs, which polarized and reversed the 
M2-like TAM phenotype and remodeled the tumor microenvironment to allow killing 
of tumor cells.

Shp1, encoded by the gene Ptpn6, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that 
transduces inhibitory signals downstream of immunoreceptors in many immune cell 
types. Blocking Shp1 activity represents an exciting potential immunotherapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of cancer, as Shp1 inhibition would be predicted to 
unleash both innate and adaptive immunity against tumor cells. Antibodies 
blocking the interaction between CD47 on tumor cells and SIRPα on macrophages 
enhance macrophage phagocytosis, show efficacy in preclinical tumor models, and 
are being evaluated in the clinic. Here we found that Shp1 bound to 
phosphorylated peptide sequences derived from SIRPα and transduced the 
anti-phagocytic signal, as Shp1 loss in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages 
increased phagocytosis of tumor cells in vitro. We also generated a novel mouse 
model to evaluate the impact of global, inducible Ptpn6 deletion on anti-tumor 
immunity. We found that inducible Shp1 loss drove an inflammatory disease in 
mice that was phenotypically similar to that seen when Ptpn6 is knocked out from 
birth. This indicates that acute perturbation of Shp1 in vivo could drive 
hyperactivation of immune cells, which could be therapeutically beneficial, 
though at the risk of potential toxicity. In this model, we found that Shp1 loss 
led to robust anti-tumor immunity against two immune-rich syngeneic tumor models 
that are moderately inflamed though not responsive to checkpoint inhibitors, 
MC38 and E0771. Shp1 loss did not promote anti-tumor activity in the 
non-inflamed B16F10 model. The observed activity in MC38 and E0771 tumors was 
likely due to effects of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Following Shp1 
deletion, we observed increases in intratumoral myeloid cells in both models, 
which was more striking in E0771 tumors. E0771 tumors also contained an 
increased ratio of effector to regulatory T cells following Shp1 loss. This was 
not observed for MC38 tumors, though we did find increased levels of IFNγ, a 
cytokine produced by effector T cells, in these tumors. Overall, our preclinical 
data suggested that targeting Shp1 may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for 
boosting the immune response to cancer via a mechanism involving both innate and 
adaptive leukocytes.

Macrophages play a key role in defending against foreign pathogens, healing 
wounds, and regulating tissue homeostasis. Driving this versatility is their 
phenotypic plasticity, which enables macrophages to respond to subtle cues in 
tightly coordinated ways. However, when this coordination is disrupted, 
macrophages can aid the progression of numerous diseases, including cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease. The central link between these 
disorders is aberrant macrophage polarization, which misguides their functional 
programs, secretory products, and regulation of the surrounding tissue 
microenvironment. As a result of their important and deterministic roles in both 
health and disease, macrophages have gained considerable attention as targets 
for drug delivery. Here, we discuss the role of macrophages in the initiation 
and progression of various inflammatory diseases, summarize the leading drugs 
used to regulate macrophages, and review drug delivery systems designed to 
target macrophages. We emphasize strategies that are approved for clinical use 
or are poised for clinical investigation. Finally, we provide a prospectus of 
the future of macrophage-targeted drug delivery systems.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for almost 80% of such death. Tumor 
associated macrophage (TAMs) are abundant components in NSCLC. TAMs play 
critical roles in angiogenesis, immune escape and chemoresistance. Here we 
developed a dual-targeting drug delivery system (CaZOL@BMNPs) of zoledronate, 
which could bind to both tumor cells with overexpressed biotin receptors and 
macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) positive TAMs. The biotin- and 
mannose-modified lipid coated calcium zoledronate nanoparticles were 
preferentially internalized in both tumor cells and TAMs, and thereby inhibited 
their survivals. Our studies demonstrated that CaZOl@BMNPs treatment obviously 
reduced angiogenesis, reprogrammed immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and 
eventually restrained tumor progression with negligible systemic toxicity. 
Collectively, CaZOL@BMNPs could be a promising approach by dual-targeting tumor 
cells and TAMs for NSCLS chemoimmunotherapy.

Glioblastoma exhibits high mortality rates due to challenges with drug delivery 
to the brain and into solid tumors. This two-pronged barrier necessitates high 
doses of systemic therapies, resulting in significant off-target toxicities. 
Recently, dendrimer-nanomedicines (without ligands) have shown promise for 
targeting specific cells in brain tumors from systemic circulation, for improved 
efficacy and amelioration of systemic toxicities. A dendrimer-rapamycin 
conjugate (D-Rapa) is presented here that specifically targets tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) in glioblastoma from systemic administration. D-Rapa improves 
suppression of pro-tumor expression in activated TAMs and antiproliferative 
properties of rapamycin in glioma cells in vitro. In vivo, D-Rapa localizes 
specifically within TAMs, acting as depots to release rapamycin into the tumor 
microenvironment. This targeted delivery strategy yields improved reduction in 
tumor burden and systemic toxicities in a challenging, clinically relevant 
orthotopic syngeneic model of glioblastoma, demonstrating the significant 
potential of dendrimers as targeted immunotherapies for improving glioblastoma 
treatment, still an unmet need.

Immune infiltration is typically quantified using cellular density, not 
accounting for cellular clustering. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) activate 
oncogenic signaling through paracrine interactions with tumor cells, which may 
be better reflected by local cellular clustering than global density metrics. 
Using multiplex immunohistochemistry and digital pathologic analysis we 
quantified cellular density and cellular clustering for myeloid cell markers in 
129 regions of interest from 55 samples from 35 patients with metastatic ccRCC. 
CD68+ cells were found to be clustered with tumor cells and dispersed from 
stromal cells, while CD163+ and CD206+ cells were found to be clustered with 
stromal cells and dispersed from tumor cells. CD68+ density was not associated 
with OS, while high tumor/CD68+ cell clustering was associated with 
significantly worse OS. These novel findings would not have been identified if 
immune infiltrate was assessed using cellular density alone, highlighting the 
importance of including spatial analysis in studies of immune cell infiltration 
of tumors. Significance: Increased clustering of CD68+ TAMs and tumor cells was 
associated with worse overall survival for patients with metastatic ccRCC. This 
effect would not have been identified if immune infiltrate was assessed using 
cell density alone, highlighting the importance of including spatial analysis in 
studies of immune cell infiltration of tumors.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are closely related with poor prognosis of 
cancers. The current study investigated whether lupeol regulates TAMs by 
focusing on the recruitment and polarization of macrophages. We found that 
lupeol suppressed the recruitment of THP-1 macrophages (THP-1 cells 
differentiated into macrophages) towards H1299 lung carcinoma cells by 
inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) production from 
H1299 cells. The reduced migration of THP-1 macrophages by lupeol was recovered 
by adding recombinant human PAI-1 as a chemoattractant. Knockdown of PAI-1 or 
treatment of tiplaxtinin, a PAI-1 inhibitor, in H1299 cells abrogated the 
chemotaxis of macrophages. Furthermore, lupeol suppressed the interleukin 
(IL)-4- and IL-13-induced M2 macrophage polarization. The mRNA expression of M2 
macrophage markers and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 6 (STAT6) were commonly decreased by lupeol in RAW264.7 cells. In 
addition, lupeol-suppressed M2 macrophage polarization led to the reduced 
migration of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Taken together, our results 
suggest that lupeol attenuates PAI-1-mediated macrophage recruitment towards 
cancer cells and inhibits M2 macrophage polarization.

INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus with a high oncogenic potential (HR-HPV) is 
responsible for more than a half of squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx. 
The HR-HPV-dependent cases of this tumour have a better prognosis compared to 
the HR-HPV-negative cases, despite the usually more advanced disease at the time 
of diagnosis. In addition to genetic and epigenetic factors, the causes of this 
more favourable course of the disease are also seen in the participation of the 
tumour microenvironment, including the patient's immune system. Macrophages are 
one of the most important elements of the immunocompetent cells landscape that 
make up the tumour microenvironment. Traditionally, they are divided into 2 
groups: inflammatory macrophages with the M1 phenotype and tumour-associated 
macrophages known as M2 phenotype macrophages.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the macrophage 
infiltrates intensity of the M1/M2 and M2 phenotype separately on the clinical 
outcome of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC), 
taking into account the HR-HPV status of tumours.
METHODS: The study involved 85 patients with OPSCC in which HR-HPV status in 
tumour tissue was determined using a double-check algorithm including the 
detection of viral DNA by RT-PCR method with subsequent confirmation of its 
biological activity by immunohistochemical demonstrating the P16INK4A protein 
overexpression. In each of the groups formed on the basis of HR-HPV status, 
macrophages were discriminated using CD68 and CD163 proteins as markers of 
pan-macrophage and M2 phenotype. The intensity of infiltrates was quantified by 
means of computer-assisted analysis in digital images of whole slides (virtual 
slides) separately in tumour tissue and stroma.
RESULTS: In HPV-positive patients, significantly more intense infiltration of 
both M1/M2 and M2 macrophages was found in the tumour stroma compared to 
HPV-negative patients. The infiltrates from both types of macrophages in the 
tumour tissue were less intense and did not differ between these groups. 
Intensive infiltration of CD68+ macrophages in the tumour front was associated 
with higher rate of nodal failures and a shorter nodal control in both HR-HPV 
groups. In the group of HR-HPV-negative patients, heavy infiltration of CD163+ 
macrophages was associated with significantly shorter: loco-regional control 
(LRC), metastasis-free survival and overall survival (OS). These parameters and 
prognosis in patients with scanty CD163+ infiltration were similar to favourable 
outcomes in HR-HPV-positive patients. The relative risk of local-regional 
recurrence, distant metastases and disease-related death in HR-HPV-negative 
patients with intense CD163+ infiltrates was, respectively, 4.7, 5.4 and 5.7 
compared to patients with scanty infiltrates.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumours with a positive HR-HPV status demonstrate intense 
infiltrations of total pool M1/M2 and M2 macrophages. In the group of 
HPV-negative patients, intensive M1/M2 macrophage infiltrates correlate with 
higher risk of nodal failures, and intensive M2 infiltrates are an adverse 
prognostic factor for LRC, metastasis-free survival and OS.

As macrophages exhibit a huge functional plasticity under homeostasis and 
pathological conditions, they have become a therapeutic target for chronic 
inflammatory diseases. Hence, the identification of macrophage subset-specific 
markers is a requisite for the development of macrophage-directed therapeutic 
interventions. In this regard, the macrophage-specific Folate Receptor β (FRβ, 
encoded by the FOLR2 gene) has been already validated as a target for molecular 
delivery in cancer as well as in macrophage-targeting therapeutic strategies for 
chronic inflammatory pathologies. We now show that the transcriptome of human 
macrophages from healthy and inflamed tissues (tumor; rheumatoid arthritis, RA) 
share a significant over-representation of the "anti-inflammatory gene set", 
which defines the gene profile of M-CSF-dependent IL-10-producing human 
macrophages (M-MØ). More specifically, FOLR2 expression has been found to 
strongly correlate with the expression of M-MØ-specific genes in tissue-resident 
macrophages, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and macrophages from inflamed 
synovium, and also correlates with the presence of the PU.1 transcription 
factor. In fact, PU.1-binding elements are found upstream of the first exon of 
FOLR2 and most M-MØ-specific- and TAM-specific genes. The functional relevance 
of PU.1 binding was demonstrated through analysis of the proximal regulatory 
region of the FOLR2 gene, whose activity was dependent on a cluster of 
PU.1-binding sequences. Further, siRNA-mediated knockdown established the 
importance of PU.1 for FOLR2 gene expression in myeloid cells. Therefore, we 
provide evidence that FRβ marks tissue-resident macrophages as well as 
macrophages within inflamed tissues, and its expression is dependent on PU.1.

In addition of being directly tumoricidal, oncolytic viruses have emerged as 
potent partners for established and investigational immunotherapies due to their 
immune-stimulatory effects. The shifting focus on virus-mediated immune 
modulation calls for a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) and the factors orchestrating the antiviral and antitumor immune response. 
The oncolytic VSV-GP studied in our lab is a safe and potent antitumor agent 
with a fast replication cycle and killing of a broad range of different cancer 
types. It induces a robust local inflammatory conversion of the TME and drives a 
strong adaptive immune response toward the tumor. Here we present our 
multidisciplinary approach to study VSV-GP treatment effects in tumors by 
assessing both immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated 
macrophages) and immune-regulatory factors (cytokines) as well as characterizing 
immune signatures using an immune-targeted NanoString gene expression system.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have a significant presence in the tumor 
stroma across multiple human malignancies and are believed to be beneficial to 
tumor growth. Targeting CSF1R has been proposed as a potential therapy to reduce 
TAMs, especially the protumor, immune-suppressive M2 TAMs. Additionally, the 
high expression of CSF1R on tumor cells has been associated with poor survival 
in certain cancers, suggesting tumor dependency and therefore a potential 
therapeutic target. The CSF1-CSF1R signaling pathway modulates the production, 
differentiation, and function of TAMs; however, the discovery of selective CSF1R 
inhibitors devoid of type III kinase activity has proven to be challenging. We 
discovered a potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable CSF1R inhibitor, 
IACS-9439 (1). Treatment with 1 led to a dose-dependent reduction in 
macrophages, promoted macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype, and led 
to tumor growth inhibition in MC38 and PANC02 syngeneic tumor models.

In the current study, we developed a synergistic chemo-immunotherapy using 
doxorubicin (Dox) and a natural polysaccharide as immunomodulator. First, we 
isolated a polysaccharide (MPW) from the root of Lepidium meyenii Walp. (maca) 
and characterized its chemical properties. MPW contains → 4) -α-D-Glcp- (1 → 
glycosidic bonds, while the terminal α-D-Glcp- (1 → group is connected to the 
main chain through an O-6 bond. This polysaccharide was then modified by 
cationization (C-MPW) to enhance immunoregulatory activity. MPW and C-MPW were 
combined with Dox and their chemo-immunotherapy effects on 4T1 tumor-bearing 
mice were assessed. Results indicated that the combination of MPW/C-MPW exerted 
a stronger anti-tumor effect than Dox alone, while reducing systemic toxicity 
and inhibiting tumor metastasis. In addition, MPW and C-MPW exerted tumor 
immunotherapy effects through the NF-κB, STAT1, and STAT3 signaling pathways, 
redirecting TAMs to the M1 phenotype that facilitates immunological responses 
against tumors. As a result, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment was 
remodeled into an immune-activated state due to enhanced secretion of IL-12, 
TNF-α, and INF-γ. Moreover, C-MPW exerted a stronger immunomodulatory effect 
than MPW. In conclusion, MPW and its cationic derivative are promising tools for 
cancer immunotherapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are regarded as the most abundantly 
infiltrating immune cells around the tumor microenvironment in gliomas, which 
plays an important role in tumorgenesis and immunosuppression. A total of 216 
patients diagnosed with primary glioma were obtained from the Chinese Glioma 
Genome Atlas of which the RNA sequencing data was used as training set. RNA 
sequencing from the Cancer Genome Atlas was applicated for validation. We found 
that mesenchymal subtype showed strong positive correlation with 
macrophage-related genes (MRGs) expression. Survival analysis showed that high 
expression level of MRG predicted poor prognosis. A TAM-based nine-gene 
signature was constructed, which divided the samples into high- and low-risk of 
unfavorable outcome. The result of Cox regression analysis showed that the risk 
score was an independent prognostic factor in gliomas. Hence, the expression of 
TAMs was correlated with patient survival. The nine-TAM-related gene signature 
can predict patient survival efficiently.

The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is a membrane 
receptor for VEGF-A, placenta growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF-B that plays a 
crucial role in melanoma invasiveness, vasculogenic mimicry and tumor-associated 
angiogenesis. Furthermore, activation of VEGFR-1 is involved in the mobilization 
of myeloid progenitors from the bone marrow that infiltrate the tumor. 
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages have been 
involved in tumor progression and resistance to cancer treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We have recently demonstrated that the 
anti-VEGFR-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) D16F7 developed in our laboratories is 
able to inhibit melanoma growth in preclinical in vivo models and to reduce 
monocyte/macrophage progenitor mobilization and tumor infiltration by myeloid 
cells. Aim of the study was to investigate whether the anti-VEGFR-1 mAb D16F7 
affects the activity of protumoral M2 macrophages in vitro in response to PlGF 
and inhibits the recruitment of these cells to the melanoma site in vivo. 
Finally, we tested whether, through its multi-targeted action, D16F7 mAb might 
increase the efficacy of ICIs against melanoma. The results indicated that 
VEGFR-1 expression is up-regulated in human activated M2 macrophages compared to 
activated M1 cells and exposure to the D16F7 mAb decreases in vitro chemotaxis 
of activated M2 macrophages. In vivo treatment with the anti-VEGFR-1 mAb D16F7 
of B6D2F1 mice injected with syngeneic B16F10 melanoma cells resulted in tumor 
growth inhibition associated with the modification of tumor microenvironment 
that involves a decrease of melanoma infiltration by M2 macrophages and PD-1+ 
and FoxP3+ cells. These alterations result in increased M1/M2 and CD8+/FoxP3+ 
ratios, which favor an antitumor and immunostimulating milieu. Accordingly, 
D16F7 mAb increased the antitumor activity of the ICIs anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 
mAbs. Overall, these data reinforce the role of VEGFR-1-mediated-signalling as a 
valid target for reducing tumor infiltration by protumoral macrophages and for 
improving the efficacy of immunotherapy with ICIs.

Tumor microenvironment (TME) has been illustrated their clinic pathological 
significance in predicting outcomes and therapeutic efficacy by more and more 
studies. Tumor purity, which reflects the features of TME, is defined as the 
proportion of cancer cell in the tumor tissue. However, the current staging and 
prognostic prediction system in gastric cancer (GC) paid little attention to 
TME. Therefore, we carried out the study to explore the role of tumor purity in 
GC. We retrospectively collected the clinical and transcriptomic data from four 
public data sets (n = 1340), GSE15459, GSE26253, GSE62254, and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA). About 34 GC patients from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center 
(FUSCC) were assigned as an independent validation group. Tumor purity was 
measured by a computational method. Low tumor purity was associated with 
unfavorable prognosis, upregulated EMT and stemness pathways, more infiltrating 
of Tregs, M1 and M2 macrophages and a higher expression level of various immune 
checkpoints and chemokines recruiting immune suppressive cells. Our study 
indicates low tumor purity in GC was associated with unfavorable prognosis and 
immune-evasion phenotype. Further investigations toward tumor purity in GC may 
contribute to prognosis prediction and the decision of therapy strategies.

In this study, we investigated the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC patients 
with higher levels of CD68+ TAMs exhibited shorter overall survival. In 
Transwell assays, PDAC cells incubated with TAMs or conditioned media from TAM 
cells (TAM-CM) showed higher migration and invasion rates than controls. PET/CT 
scan analysis of orthotopic PDAC model mice revealed greater primary tumor 
growth and liver metastasis in the TAM-CM treatment group than the controls. H&E 
staining of liver tissues showed significantly higher numbers of metastatic 
nodules in the TAM-CM treatment group. Heat inactivation of TAM-CM significantly 
reduced Transwell migration by PDAC cells, suggesting the involvement of one or 
more secreted proteins in PDAC progression. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of 
PDAC cells treated with TAM-CM revealed significant enrichment of transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway genes. Western blot and qRT-PCR 
analysis showed that TAM-CM enhanced PDAC migration cells by inducing 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the TGF-β-Smad2/3/4-Snail signaling 
axis. The pro-tumorigenic effects of TAMs or TAM-CM were abolished by TGF-β 
signaling pathway inhibitors and neutralizing TGF-β antibody. These results 
demonstrate that TAMs promote PDAC progression through the TGF-β signaling 
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Despite the advances in treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer 
(DTC), predicting prognosis remains a challenge. Immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment may provide an insight to predicting recurrence. Therefore, the 
objective of this study was to investigate the association of tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) with recurrence in 
DTC and to identify serum cytokines that correlate with the presence of these 
immune cells in the tumor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two DTC tissues from our institutional neoplasia 
repository were stained for immunohistochemistry markers for TAMs and TANs. In 
addition, cytokine levels were analyzed from these patients from preoperative 
blood samples. TAM and TAN staining were compared with clinical data and serum 
cytokine levels.
RESULTS: Neither TAM nor TAN scores alone correlated with tumor size, the 
presence of lymph node metastases, multifocal tumors, lymphovascular or capsular 
invasion, or the presence of BRAFV600E mutation (all P > 0.05). There was no 
association with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in TAN density (mean RFS, 169.1 
versus 148.1 mo, P = 0.23) or TAM density alone (mean RFS, 121.3 versus 
205.2 mo, P = 0.54). However, when scoring from both markers were combined, 
patients with high TAM density and TAN negative scores had significantly lower 
RFS (mean RFS, 50.7 versus 187.3 mo, P = 0.04) compared with the remaining 
cohort. Patients with high TAM/negative TAN tumors had significantly lower serum 
levels of interleukin 12p70, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and 
tumor necrosis factor beta.
CONCLUSIONS: In DTCs, high density of TAMs in the absence of TANs is associated 
with worse outcome. Assessment of multiple immune cell types and serum cytokines 
may predict outcomes in DTC.

The objective of this study is to design a cancer invasion model by making use 
of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) or tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and 
gelatin hydrogel microspheres (GM) for the sustained release of drugs. The GM 
containing adenosine (A) (GM-A) were prepared and cultured with TAM to obtain 
three-dimensional (3D) TAM aggregates incorporating GM-A (3D TAM-GM-A). The GM-A 
incorporation enabled TAM to enhance the secretion level of vascular endothelial 
growth factor. When co-cultured with HepG2 liver cancer cells in an invasion 
assay, the 3D TAM-GM-A promoted the invasion rate of cancer cells. In addition, 
the E-cadherin expression level decreased to a significantly greater extent 
compared with that co-cultured with TAM aggregates incorporating GM, whereas the 
significantly higher expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin was observed. This 
indicates that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition event was induced. The GM 
containing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were prepared to incorporate 
into 3D CAF (3D CAF-GM-TGF-β1). Following a co-culture of mixed 3D CAF-GM-TGF-β1 
and 3D TAM-GM-A and every HepG2, MCF-7 breast cancer cell, or WA-hT lung cancer 
cell, the invasion rate of every cancer cell enhanced depending on the mixing 
ratio of 3D TAM-GM-A and 3D CAF-GM-TGF-β1. The amount of matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) secreted also enhanced, and the enhancement was well 
corresponded with that of cancer cell invasion rate. The higher MMP secretion 
assists the breakdown of basement membrane, leading to the higher rate of cancer 
cell invasion. This model is a promising 3D culture system to evaluate the 
invasion ability of various cancer cells in vitro. Impact statement This study 
proposes a cell culture system to enhance the tumor-associated macrophage 
function based on the combination of three-dimensional (3D) cell aggregates and 
gelatin hydrogel microspheres (GM) for adenosine delivery. An additional 
combination of 3D cancer-associated fibroblasts incorporating GM containing 
transforming growth factor-β1 allowed cancer cells to enhance their invasion 
rate. This co-culture system is promising to evaluate the ability of cancer cell 
invasion for anticancer drug screening.

Tumor immune infiltration cells (TIICs) are highly heterogeneous, not only in 
different cancer subtypes but also within different cancer regions. We conducted 
the Cell-type Identification using Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA 
Transcripts (CIBERSORT) method. We assessed the relative proportions of 22 TIICs 
in HNSC using publicly available TCGA transcriptional datasets, analyzed the 
proportions of TIICs between HNSC tissues and normal tissues, along with 
accompanying clinicopathological data, and the impact of TIICs on clinical 
outcome. After the filter criteria, a total of 395 patients were included in the 
analysis. We found significant differences in naïve B cells, monocytes, resting 
mast cells, activated mast cells, CD8+ T cells, and M0 macrophages between HNSC 
tissues and adjacent non-cancer tissues. We also found that some TIIC subgroups 
were significantly associated with clinical parameters. Moreover, the patients 
with low Tregs fraction had worse OS and DFS than those with high Tregs 
fraction. However, low M0 macrophages fraction was associated with better OS and 
DFS in HNSC patients. Moreover, Tregs and M0 macrophages are likely to be 
important determinants of prognosis, which may serve as a potential 
immunotherapy target for HNSC. Then, we screened the immune-related 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), performed the GO and KEGG enrichment 
analysis, constructed the protein-protein interaction network, and screened the 
prognosis-related hub genes in HNSC. However, further clinical investigation and 
basic experiments are needed to validate our results, and uncover the molecular 
mechanisms interlinking TIICs in HNSC and their roles in prognosis and therapy.

The macrophage-associated molecule CD163 has been reported as a prognostic 
biomarker in different cancer types, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is 
unclear. We studied CD163 in the tumor microenvironment and circulation of 
patients with CRC in relation to clinicopathological parameters. An 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum sCD163 
levels and multiparameter flow cytometry was used to study the peripheral blood 
monocytes and their CD163 expression in CRC patients (N = 78) and healthy donors 
(N = 50). The distribution of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was studied in 
primary colorectal tumors with multiplex immunofluorescence. We showed that CRC 
patients with above-median sCD163 level had a shorter overall survival (OS, p = 
0.035) as well as disease-free survival (DFS, p = 0.005). The above-median 
sCD163 remained significantly associated with a shorter DFS in the multivariate 
analysis (p = 0.049). Moreover, a shorter OS was observed in CRC patients with 
an above-median total monocyte percentage (p = 0.007). The number and phenotype 
of the stromal and intraepithelial TAMs in colorectal tumors were not associated 
with clinical outcome. In conclusion, sCD163 and monocytes in the circulation 
may be potential prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients, whereas TAMs in the 
tumor showed no association with clinical outcome. Thus, our results emphasize 
the importance of the innate systemic immune response in CRC disease 
progression.

SARI (suppressor of AP-1, regulated by IFN) impaired tumour growth by promoting 
apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis in various 
cancers. However, the role of SARI in regulating tumour-associated inflammation 
microenvironment is still elusive. In our study, the colitis-dependent and 
-independent primary model were established in SARI deficiency mice and 
immuno-reconstructive mice to investigate the functional role of SARI in 
regulating tumour-associated inflammation microenvironment and primary colon 
cancer formation. The results have shown that SARI deficiency promotes 
colitis-associated cancer (CAC) development only in the presence of colon 
inflammation. SARI inhibited tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) infiltration in 
colon tissues, and SARI deficiency in bone marrow cells has no observed role in 
the promotion of intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanism investigations indicated 
that SARI down-regulates p-STAT1 and STAT1 expression in colon cancer cells, 
following inhibition of MCP-1/CCR2 axis activation during CAC development. 
Inverse correlations between SARI expression and macrophage infiltration, MCP-1 
expression and p-STAT1 expression were also demonstrated in colon malignant 
tissues. Collectively, our results prove the inhibition role of SARI in colon 
cancer formation through regulating TAM infiltration.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cordyceps sinensis is a traditional Chinese 
medicine. It is widely reported that Cordyceps sinensis has inhibitory effect on 
tumor growth and immunoregulation effect on macrophages. However, the exact 
mechanism of Cordyceps sinensis on macrophage polarization in tumor progression 
is not known.
AIM OF STUDY: We aimed to investigate the role of extracts of Cordyceps sinensis 
on macrophage polarization and its underlying mechanism in antitumor activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 4T1 orthotopic xenograft mouse model and 
immunohistochemical staining were used to investigate the effect of Cordyceps 
sinensis on breast tumor and the change of the macrophages phenotype in the 
tumor, respectively. A 3D co-culture assay was used to confirm the activity in 
vitro. Measurement of cytokines and NO, quantitative real-time PCR and flow 
cytometry assays were used to investigate the effect of Cordyceps sinensis on 
the macrophage polarization in vitro. The mechanism of the effect of Cordyceps 
sinensis on macrophages was investigated by using western blot assays.
RESULTS: In the orthotopic mouse tumor model, Cordyceps sinensis inhibited the 
4T1 tumor growth in a dose dependent manner, and the immunohistochemical 
staining analysis showed that there is a positive correlation between tumor 
growth inhibition and macrophage M1-like polarized phenotype. The cytokines and 
NO measurement, quantitative real-time PCR assay and flow cytometry assays 
confirmed that Cordyceps sinensis could promote macrophage differentiation 
toward the M1 phenotype. The 3D co-culture assay and western blot assay showed 
that Cordyceps sinensis could inhibit tumor growth by promoting macrophage 
polarization and enhance its activity by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Cordyceps sinensis could potently 
suppress TNBC progression by promoting M1 phenotypic differentiation of 
macrophages via activation NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor microenvironment.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are recognized as a hallmark of certain 
solid cancers and predictors of poor prognosis; however, the functional role of 
TAMs in lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell lymphoma, has not been well 
defined. We identified infiltration of F4/80+ TAMs in a syngeneic mouse model 
using the recently generated murine mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line 
FC-muMCL1. Multicolor flow cytometric analysis of syngeneic lymphoma tumors 
showed distinct polarization of F4/80+ TAMs into CD206+ M2 and CD80+ M1 
phenotypes. Using human MCL cell lines (Mino, Granta, and JVM2), we further 
showed that MCL cells polarized monocyte-derived macrophages toward an M2-like 
phenotype, as assessed by CD163+ expression and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) 
level; however, levels of the M1 markers CD80 and IL-12 remained unaffected. To 
show that macrophages contribute to MCL tumorigenesis, we xenografted the human 
MCL cell line Mino along with CD14+ monocytes and compared tumor growth between 
these 2 groups. Results showed that xenografted Mino along with CD14+ monocytes 
significantly increased the tumor growth in vivo compared with MCL cells alone 
(P < .001), whereas treatment with liposomal clodronate (to deplete the 
macrophages) reversed the effect of CD14+ monocytes on growth of MCL xenografts 
(P < .001). Mechanistically, IL-10 secreted by MCL-polarized M2-like macrophages 
was found to be responsible for increasing MCL growth by activating STAT1 
signaling, whereas IL-10 neutralizing antibody or STAT1 inhibition by 
fludarabine or STAT1 short hairpin RNA significantly abolished MCL growth (P < 
.01). Collectively, our data show the existence of a tumor microenvironmental 
network of macrophages and MCL tumor and suggest the importance of macrophages 
in interventional therapeutic strategies against MCL and other lymphoid 
malignancies.

The histological architecture of certain aggressive B-cell lymphomas 
(prototypically Burkitt's lymphoma, BL) is characterized by a "starry-sky" (SS) 
appearance. This is caused by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which appear 
in standard histological preparations as "stars" in a darkly stained "sky" of 
lymphoma cells. SS-TAMs accumulate in response to constitutive apoptosis in 
these tumors and are activated by the apoptotic tumor cells to a pro-oncogenic 
phenotype. The extent to which SS-TAMs contribute to lymphoma growth through 
responses generated by interactions with apoptotic tumor cells is unknown. Here, 
we demonstrate a role for the receptor tyrosine kinase, MERTK, in the oncogenic 
activity of SS-TAMs. We show that MERTK expression is largely restricted to the 
macrophages of human BL and of murine models of SS B-cell lymphoma and that it 
is upregulated in SS-TAMs as compared to the germinal center or paracortical 
macrophages of normal lymph nodes. Our results further demonstrate that MERTK is 
active in the phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphoma cells by macrophages and, most 
significantly, that SS lymphoma growth is markedly inhibited in Mertk -/- mice. 
These results point toward the MERTK apoptotic-cell clearance/response pathway 
playing a key role in growth of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and identifies MERTK 
as a novel potential antilymphoma target.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are pivotal in remodeling of the 
tumor immune microenvironment and clinical outcome. Herein, we aim to evaluate 
the impact of immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of CD68 and CD163 in TAM on 
clinico-pathological features, patients' response to therapy and the overall 
survival (OS).
RESULTS: This retrospective study was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue 
blocks of 100 classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) cases diagnosed and treated at our 
Institution. Immunohistochemical scores of CD68 and CD163 were statistically 
related to bulky disease (p value = 0.005 for both), tumor stage (p value = 0.02 
for both), International Prognostic Score (IPS) (p value = 0.04 and 0.02 
respectively), and the overall response rate (ORR) (p value = 0.001). 
Additionally, CD163 was also statistically related to gender (p value = 0.02), 
serum albumin level (p value = 0.03), and B symptoms (p value = 0.04). HCV 
seropositivity did not relate to either CD68 or CD163 score. Using univariate 
analysis revealed that B symptoms, bulky disease, IPS ≥ 3, and CD163 > 25% were 
associated with lower OS (p values = 0.003, 0.006, 0.001, and < 0.001 
respectively), while after multivariate cox regression analysis, B symptoms, IPS 
≥ 3, and CD163 > 25% were related to inferior OS (p values 0.02, 0.02, and 
0.003).
CONCLUSION: CD163 expressing TAM is a powerful predictor for OS in cHL, unlike 
CD68.

M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2 TAMs) play important roles in the 
resistance of tumors to immunotherapies. Selective depletion or reprogramming of 
M2 TAMs may sensitize the nonresponsive tumors for immune-mediated eradication. 
However, precision delivery of payloads to M2 TAMs, while sparing healthy 
tissues, has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, we studied the application 
of a short linear peptide (CSPGAK, "mUNO") for the delivery of molecular and 
nanoscale cargoes in M2 TAMs in vitro and the relevance of the peptide for in 
vivo targeting of early-stage primary breast tumors and metastatic lung foci. 
First, we performed in silico modeling and found that mUNO interacts with mouse 
CD206 via a binding site between lectin domains CTLD1 and CTLD2, the same site 
previously demonstrated to be involved in mUNO binding to human CD206. Second, 
we showed that cultured M2 macrophages take up fluorescein-labeled (FAM) 
polymersomes conjugated with mUNO using the sulfhydryl group of its N-terminal 
cysteine. Pulse/chase studies of FAM-mUNO in M2 macrophages suggested that the 
peptide avoided lysosomal entrapment and escaped from early endosomes. Third, 
our in vivo studies with FAM-mUNO demonstrated that intraperitoneal 
administration results in better pharmacokinetics and higher blood 
bioavailability than can be achieved with intravenous administration. 
Intraperitoneal FAM-mUNO, but not FAM-control, showed a robust accumulation in 
M2-skewed macrophages in mouse models of early primary breast tumor and lung 
metastasis. This targeting was specific, as no uptake was observed in 
nonmalignant control organs, including the liver, or other cell types in the 
tumor, including M1 macrophages. Collectively, our studies support the 
application of the CD206-binding mUNO peptide for delivery of molecular and 
nanoscale cargoes to M2 macrophages and manifest the relevance of this mode of 
targeting primary and metastatic breast tumors.

The lungs are major sites of metastases for several cancer types, including 
breast cancer (BC). Prognosis and quality of life of BC patients that develop 
pulmonary metastases are negatively impacted. The development of strategies to 
slow the growth and relieve the symptoms of BC lung metastases (BCLM) is thus an 
important goal in the management of BC. However, systemically administered first 
line small molecule chemotherapeutics have poor pharmacokinetic profiles and 
biodistribution to the lungs and significant off-target toxicity, severely 
compromising their effectiveness. In this work, we propose the local delivery of 
add-on immunotherapy to the lungs to support first line chemotherapy treatment 
of advanced BC. In a syngeneic murine model of BCLM, we show that local 
pulmonary administration (p.a.) of PLX-3397 (PLX), a colony-stimulating factor 1 
receptor inhibitor (CSF-1Ri), is capable of overcoming physiological barriers of 
the lung epithelium, penetrating the tumor microenvironment (TME), and 
decreasing phosphorylation of CSF-1 receptors, as shown by the Western blot of 
lung tumor nodules. That inhibition is accompanied by an overall decrease in the 
abundance of protumorigenic (M2-like) macrophages in the TME, with a concomitant 
increase in the amount of antitumor (M1-like) macrophages when compared to the 
vehicle-treated control. These effects with PLX (p.a.) were achieved using a 
much smaller dose (1 mg/kg, every other day) compared to the systemic doses 
typically used in preclinical studies (40-800 mg/kg/day). As an additive in 
combination with intravenous (i.v.) administration of paclitaxel (PTX), PLX 
(p.a.) leads to a decrease in tumor burden without additional toxicity. These 
results suggested that the proposed immunochemotherapy, with regional pulmonary 
delivery of PLX along with the i.v. standard of care chemotherapy, may lead to 
new opportunities to improve treatment, quality of life, and survival of 
patients with BCLM.

Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) has shown anti-tumorigenic properties in certain 
cancers for its effect of boosting the body's immune system, but its role in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effect of AS-IV in CRC and explored its underlying mechanism. CT26 
colon cancer cells and mouse model by injection of CT26 cells subcutaneously 
were used as in vitro and in vivo model. M1 and M2 macrophage-associated 
markers, mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed after AS-IV treatment. 
Inflammatory factors and cytokines in the tumors from mouse model were detected. 
Repolarization effect of AS-IV in vitro on bone-marrow-derived macrophages was 
also detected. In vitro, AS-IV inhibited the proliferation of CT26 cells and 
induced cell apoptosis dose-dependently, and significantly reduced M2 
macrophages and increased M1 macrophages. In mouse model, it suppressed tumor 
growth and decreased the production of anti-inflammatory factors such as TGF-β, 
IL-10 and VEGF-A, while increased the production of pro-inflammatory factors 
like IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α in tumor. Combination of AS-IV and checkpoint 
inhibitor aPD-1 exhibited synergistic antitumor effect by inhibiting tumor 
growth and increasing T cell infiltration. AS-IV could induce M2 macrophages 
polarization to the M1 phenotype. Its combination with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors could be expected to become a potential new strategy for the 
treatment of CRC.

Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), which possess M2-like characters and are 
derived from immature monocytes in the circulatory system, represent a 
predominant population of inflammatory cells in solid tumours. TAM infiltration 
in tumour microenvironment can be used as an important prognostic marker in many 
cancer types and is a potential target for cancer prevention or treatment. 
VEGI-251 not only is involved in the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, but also 
participates in the regulation of host immunity. This work aimed to investigate 
the involvement of VEGI-251 in the regulation of specific antitumour immunity. 
We found that recombinant human VEGI-251(rhVEGI-251) efficiently mediated the 
elimination of TAMs in tumour tissue in mice, and induced apoptosis of purified 
TAMs in vitro. During this process, caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated, 
leading to PARP cleavage and apoptosis. Most importantly, we further elucidated 
the mechanism underlying VEGI-251-triggered TAM apoptosis, which suggests that 
ASK1, an intermediate component of the VEGI-251, activates the JNK pathway via 
TRAF2 in a potentially DR3-dependent manner in the process of TAM apoptosis. 
Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the basic mechanisms 
underlying the actions of VEGI-251 that might lead to future development of 
antitumour therapeutic strategies using VEGI-251 to target TAMs.

BET inhibitors (BETi) exhibit a strong anti-tumor activity in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC). However, BETi resistance has been reported in TNBC. The 
mechanisms of resistance have not been demonstrated. Tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) are frequently involved in cancer cells resistance to 
chemotherapy, also associated with poor prognosis in TNBC. However, the role of 
TAMs in BETi resistance remains unknown. Here, we found that BETi JQ1 and 
I-BET151 exerted anti-tumor effects in TNBC by decreasing IKBKE expression to 
attenuate NF-κB signaling. TAMs have been reported to associate with 
chemoresistance in breast cancer. Here, we firstly found that TNBC-stimulated 
TAMs activated NF-κB signaling by upregulating IKBKE expression to enhance 
breast cancer cells resistance to BETi. The IKBKE levels were also proved to be 
higher in clinical TNBC tissues than Non-TNBC tissues, suggesting feedback 
induction of IKBKE expression by TNBC-stimulated TAMs in TNBC. Moreover, the 
induction of IKBKE by TAMs in TNBC cells was identified to be associated with 
STAT3 signaling, which was activated by TAM-secreted IL-6 and IL-10. Lastly, the 
combination of inhibitors of BET and STAT3 exerted a synergistic inhibition 
effects in TAM-cocultured or TAM CM-treated TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. 
Altogether, our findings illustrated TNBC-activated macrophages conferred TNBC 
cells resistance to BETi via IL-6 or IL-10/STAT3/IKBKE/NF-κB axis. Blockade of 
IKBKE or double inhibition of BET and STAT3 might be a novel strategy for 
treatment of TNBC.

APOMAB (chDAB4) is a dead tumour cell-targeting antibody which has been used 
preclinically as a diagnostic agent and therapeutically as a radioimmunotherapy 
and antibody drug conjugate (ADC). However, little is known of the intra-tumour 
processing of chDAB4 when bound to dead tumour cells. In this study we examine 
the role of macrophages in the in vitro and in vivo processing of radiolabelled 
chDAB4 and a chDAB4 ADC. We found that chDAB4 binds to macrophages in vitro, 
resulting in the killing of macrophages when using the ADC, chDAB4-SG3249. Free 
drug released by the macrophage processing of chDAB4-SG3249 could result in 
killing of 'bystander' Lewis lung (LL2) carcinoma cells. Furthermore, 
macrophages phagocytosed chDAB4-bound dead LL2 cells and were killed when they 
phagocytosed chDAB4-SG3249-bound dead LL2 cells in vitro. In vivo, we found 
markedly different tumour retention of chDAB4 in the LL2 tumour model depending 
on whether it was radiolabelled with a residualising radionuclide (89Zr), which 
is retained intracellularly, or a non-residualising radionuclide (124I), which 
can diffuse out of the cell. This prolonged retention of 89Zr vs124I indicated 
intra-tumoral processing of chDAB4 in vivo. The tumour uptake of 89Zr-chDAB4 was 
reduced after macrophage depletion, which also reduced the efficacy of the 
chDAB4 ADC in vivo. This study shows that macrophages can process chDAB4 and 
chDAB4 ADC in vitro and shows the importance of tumour-associated macrophages in 
the tumour retention of chDAB4 and the efficacy of chDAB4 ADC in vivo.

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells play critical roles in immune-mediated tumor 
rejection and/or progression, and are key targets of immunotherapies. Estimation 
of different immune subsets becomes increasingly important with the decreased 
cost of high-throughput molecular profiling and the rapidly growing amount of 
cancer genomics data. Here, we present Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), 
an in silico deconvolution method for inference of tumor-infiltrating immune 
components. TIMER takes bulk tissue gene expression profiles measured with 
RNA-seq or microarray to evaluate the abundance of six immune cell types in the 
tumor microenvironment: B cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, neutrophil, 
macrophage, and dendritic cell. We further introduce its associated webserver 
for convenient, user-friendly analysis of tumor immune infiltrates across 
multiple cancer types.

Macrophages, which can secret various inflammation mediators, have an essential 
role in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism(s) to regulate the 
production of inflammation mediator is not completely clear. Here we found that 
TRIM 59 could inhibit the production of NO and the expression of inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cytochrome c oxidase subunit2 (COX2) and TNFα. 
TRIM59 mediated suppression on nitric oxide (NO) production is through 
inhibiting the activation of JAK2-STAT1 signal pathway. In response to LPS, 
TRIM59 in macrophages was translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus and directly 
bound with STAT1. During this process, TRIM59 could recruit much more PIAS1 to 
bind with STAT1 to suppress the activation of STAT1. Finally, TRIM59 modified 
macrophages could promote tumor growth. Thus, TRIM59 mediated suppression on NO 
production by promoting the binding of PIAS1 and STAT1 in macrophages may 
regulate tumor growth.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with its high recurrence and metastasis rates, 
is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and available treatments include 
surgical resection and liver transplantation. TOGA is a novel conjugate 
combining 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), an active component of licorice, and 
tetramethylpyrazine, an effective component of Chuanxiong, with a small-molecule 
amino acid. This study examined the anti-hepatoma effects of TOGA and its 
specific mechanisms of action. We found that TOGA significantly prevented tumor 
growth in both nude mice carrying liver cancer xenograftsand mice carrying 
orthotopic tumors with little toxicity. NanoString analysis screening 
illustrated that TOGA may exert its anti-tumor effects by targeting interleukin 
(IL)-1R receptor 1 (IL-1R1). Further, TOGA significantly prevented the invasion 
and migration of HepG2 cells induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or 
IL-1β, as confirmed by the reduced expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT)-related proteins Snail and Vimentin. Furthermore, IL-1β-induced 
activation of the IL-1R1/IκB/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway in HepG2 cells was 
proved to be inhibited by TOGA. Taken together, TOGA effectively prevents the 
support of TAMs from fueling tumorigenesis through a mechanism related to the 
NF-κB pathway, and it may be a promising GA-modified drug for the treatment of 
HCC.

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells play a decisive part in prognosis and survival. 
Until now, previous researches have not made clear about the diversity of cell 
types involved in the immune response. The objective of this work was to confirm 
the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their correlation with 
prognosis in meningiomas based on a metagene approach (known as CIBERSORT) and 
online databases. A total of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells were detected to 
determine the relationship between the immune infiltration pattern and survival. 
The proportion of M2 macrophages was more abundant in 68 samples, reaching more 
than 36%. Univariate Cox regression analysis displayed that the proportion of 
dendritic cells was obviously related to prognosis. Hierarchical clustering 
analysis identified two clusters by the method of within sum of squares errors, 
which exhibited different infiltrating immune cell composition and survival. To 
summarize, our results indicated that proportions of tumor-infiltrating immune 
cells as well as cluster patterns were associated with the prognosis, which 
offered clinical significance for research of meningiomas.

The presence of immunosuppressive macrophages that become activated in the tumor 
microenvironment constitutes a major factor responsible for tumor growth and 
malignancy. In line with this knowledge, we report here that macrophage 
proliferation is a significant feature of advanced stages of cancer. Moreover, 
we have found that a high proportion of proliferating macrophages in human 
tumors express ERK5. ERK5 was required for supporting the proliferation of 
macrophages in tumor grafts in mice. Furthermore, myeloid ERK5 deficiency 
negatively impacted the proliferation of both resident and infiltrated 
macrophages in metastatic lung nodules. ERK5 maintained the capacity of 
macrophages to proliferate by suppressing p21 expression to halt their 
differentiation program. Collectively, these data provide insight into the 
mechanism underpinning macrophage proliferation to support malignant tumor 
development, thereby strengthening the value of ERK5-targeted therapies to 
restore antitumor immunity through the blockade of protumorigenic macrophage 
activation. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings offer a new rationale for anti-ERK5 
therapy to improve cancer patient outcomes by blocking the proliferative 
activity of tumor macrophages.

Colon cancer is a common and deadly human digestive tract malignant tumor with 
poor prognosis. Immunotherapy has elicited tremendous success as a treatment 
modality for multiple solid tumors. Triptolide is extracted from the traditional 
Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F which shows various 
pharmacological actions including antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, 
antifibrosis, and antirheumatic. However, the influence of triptolide treatment 
on remodeling tumor immune microenvironment is still unknown in colon cancer. 
This study was aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of triptolide 
treatment on colon cancer and the impact on tumor immune microenvironment and 
its underlying mechanism. We used CT26 subcutaneous tumors to conduct in vivo 
experiments and HT29, CT16, and Raw264.7 cells to perform in vitro assays. 
Triptolide had a therapeutic effect against colon cancer in vivo. Triptolide 
treatment distinctly inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells and 
induced apoptosis in vitro. In colon cancer immune microenvironment, triptolide 
treatment decreased the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages through 
downregulating tumor-derived CXCL12 expression via nuclear factor kappa B and 
extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 axis to remodel the 
immune microenvironment. Triptolide-educated colon cancers retarded the 
macrophages polarize to anti-inflammatory M2 status by decreasing the expression 
of Arg-1, CD206, and interleukin-10. Moreover, triptolide inhibited the 
migration of colon cancer cells via decreasing vascular endothelial growth 
factor expression. Our results identified the role of triptolide treatment in 
remodeling colon cancer immune microenvironment along with the distinct 
cytotoxicity function against colon cancer cells, which may provide the evidence 
for triptolide treatment in clinical.

Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), with M2-like immunosuppressive 
profiles, are key players in the development and dissemination of tumors. Hence, 
the induction of M1 pro-inflammatory and anti-tumoral states is critical to 
fight against cancer cells. The activation of the endosomal toll-like receptor 3 
by its agonist poly(I:C) has shown to efficiently drive this polarization 
process. Unfortunately, poly(I:C) presents significant systemic toxicity, and 
its clinical use is restricted to a local administration. Therefore, the 
objective of this work has been to facilitate the delivery of poly(I:C) to 
macrophages through the use of nanotechnology, that will ultimately drive their 
phenotype toward pro-inflammatory states. Methods: Poly(I:C) was complexed to 
arginine-rich polypeptides, and then further enveloped with an anionic polymeric 
layer either by film hydration or incubation. Physicochemical characterization 
of the nanocomplexes was conducted by dynamic light scattering and transmission 
electron microscopy, and poly(I:C) association efficiency by gel 
electrophoresis. Primary human-derived macrophages were used as relevant in 
vitro cell model. Alamar Blue assay, ELISA, PCR and flow cytometry were used to 
determine macrophage viability, polarization, chemokine secretion and uptake of 
nanocomplexes. The cytotoxic activity of pre-treated macrophages against PANC-1 
cancer cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Results: The final poly(I:C) 
nanocomplexes presented sizes lower than 200 nm, with surface charges ranging 
from +40 to -20 mV, depending on the envelopment. They all presented high 
poly(I:C) loading values, from 12 to 50%, and great stability in cell culture 
media. In vitro, poly(I:C) nanocomplexes were highly taken up by macrophages, in 
comparison to the free molecule. Macrophage treatment with these nanocomplexes 
did not reduce their viability and efficiently stimulated the secretion of the 
T-cell recruiter chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5, of great importance for an 
effective anti-tumor immune response. Finally, poly(I:C) nanocomplexes 
significantly increased the ability of treated macrophages to directly kill 
cancer cells. Conclusion: Overall, these enveloped poly(I:C) nanocomplexes might 
represent a therapeutic option to fight cancer through the induction of 
cytotoxic M1-polarized macrophages.

It is well-established that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an 
important role in breast cancer development. Accumulating evidence suggested 
that human cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP), which is mainly expressed 
in host defense cells such as macrophages, is crucial not only in combating 
microorganisms but also promoting tumor growth. Here we report the interaction 
of CAMP with TAMs in breast cancer. CAMP expression was upregulated in cancer 
tissues and in the circulation of breast cancer patients. Surgical removal of 
tumor decreased CAMP peptide serum level. Knockdown of CAMP decreased cell 
proliferation and migration/invasion ability in breast cancer cells. CAMP 
expression was altered during macrophage M1/M2 polarization and was expressed 
predominantly in M2 phenotype. In addition, breast cancer cells co-cultured with 
macrophages upregulated CAMP expression and also increased cancer cell 
viability. Xenograft tumors reduced significantly upon CAMP receptor antagonist 
treatment. Our data implicated that CAMP confers an oncogenic role in breast 
cancer and plays an important role in the tumor microenvironment between TAMs 
and breast cancer cells, and blocking the interaction between them would provide 
a novel therapeutic option for this malignant disease.

AIMS: Tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) residing in tumor microenvironment as 
the major niche cell made remarkable contribution to tumor growth. However, the 
functional role of macrophage and its different differentiating state as well as 
the regulating mechanism in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains not 
fully clear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LSCC samples were collected from patients. Human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from volunteers' blood, 
and used for macrophage induction. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was 
performed to detect proinflammatory cytokines. Immunostaining was prepared to 
observe tumor tissues.
KEY FINDINGS: Here, we found the number of type 2 macrophage (MΦ2) and PDL-1 
expression was increased in LSCC that was correlated with poor prognosis in 
patients with LSCC. Tumor cells induced macrophage into type 2 differentiation 
by TGF-β/Smad3 signaling. The primed MΦ2 produced IL-10 by activating JAK/STAT 
signaling that promoted PDL-1 expression in tumor cells leading to its 
immunosuppression. Inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling promoted tumor cells death 
from immune cells killing by regulating PDL-1 expression. Targeting cytokines 
TGF-β or IL-10 synergistically enhances the sensitivity of tumors to 
chemotherapy in vivo.
SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, our findings showed tumor cells and MΦ2 were 
bilaterally regulated through cytokines production that integrally advanced 
tumor progression through boosting anti-tumor immunity. It provides insight to 
develop immune strategies synergy with chemotherapy in treating laryngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma.

Novel delivery strategies are necessary to effectively address glioblastoma 
without systemic toxicities. Triptolide is a therapy derived from the thunder 
god vine that has shown potent anti-proliferative and immunosuppressive 
properties but exhibits significant adverse systemic effects. Dendrimer-based 
nanomedicines have shown great potential for clinical translation of systemic 
therapies targeting neuroinflammation and brain tumors. Here we present a novel 
dendrimer-triptolide conjugate that specifically targets tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) in glioblastoma from systemic administration and exhibits 
triggered release under intracellular and intratumor conditions. This targeted 
delivery improves phenotype switching of TAMs from pro- towards anti-tumor 
expression in vitro. In an orthotopic model of glioblastoma, 
dendrimer-triptolide achieved significantly improved amelioration of tumor 
burden compared to free triptolide. Notably, the triggered release mechanism of 
dendrimer-mediated triptolide delivery significantly reduced 
triptolide-associated hepatic and cardiac toxicities. These results demonstrate 
that dendrimers are a promising targeted delivery platform to achieve effective 
glioblastoma treatment by improving efficacy while reducing systemic toxicities.

The immune infiltration of patients with gastric cancer (GC) is closely 
associated with clinical prognosis. However, previous studies failed to explain 
the different subsets of immune cells involved in immune responses and diverse 
functions. The present study aimed to uncover the differences in 
immunophenotypes in a tumor microenvironment (TME) between adjacent and tumor 
tissues and to explore their therapeutic targets. In our study, the relative 
proportion of immune cells in 229 GC tumor samples and 22 paired matched tissues 
was evaluated with a Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of 
known RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The correlation between immune cell 
infiltration and clinical information was analyzed. The proportion of 22 immune 
cell subsets was assessed to determine the correlation between each immune cell 
type and clinical features. Three molecular subtypes were identified with 
'CancerSubtypes' R-package. Functional enrichment was analyzed in each subtype. 
The profiles of immune infiltration in the GC cohort from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) varied significantly between the 22 paired tissues. TNM stage was 
associated with M1 macrophages and eosinophils. Follicular helper T cells were 
activated at the late stage. Monocytes were associated with radiation therapy. 
Three clustering processes were obtained via the 'CancerSubtypes' R-package. 
Each cancer subtype had a specific molecular classification and subtype-specific 
characterization. These findings showed that the CIBERSOFT algorithm could be 
used to detect differences in the composition of immune-infiltrating cells in GC 
samples, and these differences might be an important driver of GC progression 
and treatment response.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an integral laboratory staining technique, which 
is used for the detection of immune cells in mouse/human tissues or tumors. 
Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) treatment or virotherapy of solid tumors 
results in antitumor immune responses and infiltration of a variety of immune 
cells into the tumor. Here, we describe a step-by-step chromogen/substrate-based 
single- and dual-color IHC protocol to stain immune cells in formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded mouse glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor sections after oHSV 
virotherapy. Tumor sections are deparaffinized with xylene, then gradually 
rehydrated using ethanol, followed by heat-mediated antigen retrieval using 
appropriate buffers. Tumor sections are incubated with primary antibodies, which 
detect a specific immune cell antigen, then incubated with peroxidase- or 
phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with a 
color-producing substrate and color visualization (of immune cells) by light 
microscopy. The protocol described herein is also applicable to detect immune 
cells in other mouse and human tumors or organs after other forms of 
immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy has exhibited great potential in cancer treatment. However, for 
immunosuppressive tumors such as pancreatic cancer, immunotherapy is far from 
satisfactory. PI3K-γ and colony stimulating factor-1/colony stimulating factor-1 
receptor (CSF-1/CSF-1R) pathways are involved in the infiltration and 
polarization of immunosuppressive cells including M2 tumor associated 
macrophages (M2 TAMs), causing a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME) in pancreatic cancer. Herein, a M2 TAM targeting nanomicelle was 
developed to co-deliver PI3K-γ inhibitor NVP-BEZ 235 and CSF-1R-siRNA for 
specific TAMs reprogramming and antitumor immune responses activation. M2 TAM 
targeting peptide M2pep was modified on a mixed micelle, which was potent to 
co-encapsulate BEZ 235 and CSF-1R siRNA. The formulated nanomicelle increased M2 
TAM targeting efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with single pathway 
blockade, dual blockade of PI3k-γ and CSF-1R demonstrated enhanced TAM 
remodeling effects by reducing M2 TAM level and elevating M1 TAM level, and also 
suppressed tumor infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). 
Consequently, the M2 TAM targeting reprogramming system activated antitumor 
immune responses and achieved enhanced anti-pancreatic tumor effects via PI3K-γ 
blockade and downregulation of CSF-1R. The M2pep modified nanomicelle provides a 
promising method for co-delivery of siRNA and small molecule inhibitor to M2 
TAM. Dual inhibition of both PI3K-γ and CSF-1R can remodel TIME and activate 
antitumor immune responses synergistically, providing an alternative approach 
for pancreatic cancer treatment.

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is a critical 
up-stream mediator of interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-4 signaling and is 
constitutively activated in malignant lymphocytes from Sezary syndrome (SS) and 
mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. 
By combining genome-wide expression profiling with pharmacological STAT6 
inhibition, we have identified the genes regulated by STAT6 in MF/SS tumors. We 
found that STAT6 regulates several common pathways in MF/SS malignant 
lymphocytes that are associated with control of cell-cycle progression and 
genomic stability as well as production of Th2 cytokines. Using ex vivo skin 
explants from cutaneous MF tumors as well as Sezary cells derived from the blood 
of SS patients, we demonstrated that inhibition of STAT6 activation 
downregulates cytokine production and induces cell-cycle arrest in MF/SS 
malignant lymphocytes, inhibiting their proliferation but not their survival. 
Furthermore, we show that STAT6 promotes the protumoral M2-like phenotype of 
tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of advanced stage MF 
by upregulating the expression of genes associated with immunosuppression, 
chemotaxis, and tumor matrix remodeling. Thus, we show STAT6 to be a major 
factor in the pathogenesis and progression of MF/SS, promoting proliferation and 
invasion of the malignant lymphocytes while inducing a progressive depression of 
the antitumor immune response. Together, our results provide new insights into 
disease pathogenesis and offer new prospective targets for therapeutic 
intervention.

AIMS: Different types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells not only augment but 
also dampen antitumor immunity in the microenvironment of melanoma. Therefore, 
it is critical to provide an overview of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in 
melanoma and explore a novel strategy for immunotherapies.
METHODS: We analyzed the immune states of different stages in melanoma patients 
by the immune, stromal, and estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant 
tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) scores. Immune cell types were 
identified by the estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORTx) 
algorithm in 471 melanoma and 324 healthy tissues. Moreover, we performed a gene 
set variation analysis (GSVA) to determine the differentially regulated pathways 
in the tumor microenvironment.
RESULTS: In melanoma cohorts, we found that ESTIMATE and immune scores were 
involved in survival or tumor clinical stage. Among the 22 immune cells, CD8+ T 
cells, M2 macrophages, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) showed significant 
differences using the CIBERSORTx algorithm. Furthermore, GSVA identified the 
immune cell-related pathways; the primary immunodeficiency pathway, intestinal 
immune network for IgA, and TGF-β pathways were identified as participants of 
the crosstalk in CD8+ T cells, Tregs, and M2 macrophages in the melanoma 
microenvironment.
CONCLUSION: These results reveal the cellular and molecular characteristics of 
immune cells in melanoma, providing a method for selecting targets of 
immunotherapies and promoting the efficacy of therapies for the treatment of 
melanoma.

Macrophages are critical for regulating inflammatory responses. Environmental 
signals polarize macrophages to either a proinflammatory (M1) state or an 
anti-inflammatory (M2) state. We observed that the microRNA (miRNA) cluster 
mirn23a, coding for miRs-23a, -27a, and -24-2, regulates mouse macrophage 
polarization. Gene expression analysis of mirn23a-deficient myeloid progenitors 
revealed a decrease in TLR and IFN signaling. Mirn23a -/- bone marrow-derived 
macrophages (BMDMs) have an attenuated response to LPS, demonstrating an 
anti-inflammatory phenotype in mature cells. In vitro, mirn23a-/- BMDMs have 
decreased M1 responses and an enhanced M2 responses. Overexpression of mirn23a 
has the opposite effect, enhancing M1 and inhibiting M2 gene expression. 
Interestingly, expression of mirn23a miRNAs goes down with inflammatory 
stimulation and up with anti-inflammatory stimulation, suggesting that its 
regulation prevents locking macrophages into polarized states. M2 polarization 
of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) correlates with poor outcome for many 
tumors, so to determine if there was a functional consequence of mirn23a loss 
modulating immune cell polarization, we assayed syngeneic tumor growth in 
wild-type and mirn23a -/- mice. Consistent with the increased 
anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive phenotype in vitro, mirn23a -/- mice 
inoculated with syngeneic tumor cells had worse outcomes compared with wild-type 
mice. Coinjecting tumor cells with mirn23a -/- BMDMs into wild-type mice 
phenocopied tumor growth in mirn23a -/- mice, supporting a critical role for 
mirn23a miRNAs in macrophage-mediated tumor immunity. Our data demonstrate that 
mirn23a regulates M1/M2 polarization and suggests that manipulation of mirn23a 
miRNA can be used to direct macrophage polarization to drive a desired immune 
response.

The tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment greatly limits the efficacy of 
immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant 
immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, which can inhibit the 
tumor after converting it to an M1-like phenotype. In addition, immunogenic cell 
death (ICD) can increase the amount of T lymphocytes in tumors, activating 
antineoplastic immunity. Herein, tumor-associated macrophage polarization 
therapy supplemented with PLGA-DOX (PDOX)-induced ICD is developed for cancer 
treatment. The nanoparticles/bacteria complex (Ec-PR848) is fabricated for tumor 
targeting and TAM polarization, and PLGA-R848 (PR848) are attached to the 
surface of Escherichia coli (E. coli) MG1655 via electrostatic absorption. The 
toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist resiquimod (R848) and E. coli can 
greatly polarize M2 macrophages to M1 macrophages, while PDOX-induced ICD can 
also impair the immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment. This strategy 
shows that tumor-associated macrophage polarization therapy combined with ICD 
induced by low-dose chemotherapeutic drugs can commendably enhance the efficacy 
of immunotherapy.

The progression of lung cancer is majorly facilitated by TAMs (tumour-associated 
macrophages). However, how the TAMs infiltrate the NSCLC microenvironment and 
the associated biochemical are not fully elaborated. Research has revealed that 
changes in CtBP1 modulates innate immunity. Here, we investigated if CtBP1 
facilitates infiltration of TAM and the subsequent progression of NSCLC. 
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out in 96 NSCLC patients to estimate 
the clinicopathological importance of CtBP1 in the disease. CtBP1 overexpression 
and knockdown were carried out to assess the activity of CtBP1 in NSCLC cells. 
Elevated expression of CtBP1 correlated positively with TAMs infiltration into 
NSCLC tissues, induced EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) in NSCLC cells 
and modulated the activated NF-κB signalling pathway leading to increase in CCL2 
secretion from NSCLC cells, thus promoting TAM recruitment and polarization. TAM 
induction and polarization reduced significantly on exhausting p65 in NSCLC 
cells with CtBP1. Moreover, infiltration of TMAs was reduced remarkably on 
antagonist-mediated blocking of CCR2 and impeded the progression of NSCLC in a 
mouse model. These findings thus show a novel insight into the process of 
CtBP1-regulated TAM infiltration in NSCLC.

Rationale: Differential activation of macrophages correlates closely with tumor 
progression, and the epigenetic factor lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B, previously 
named JMJD3) mediates the regulation of macrophage polarization through an 
unknown mechanism. Methods: We developed a suspension coculture system 
comprising breast cancer cells and macrophages and used RT-qPCR and western 
blotting to measure KDM6B expression. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter 
assays were used to identify candidate microRNAs of cancer cells responsible for 
the downregulation of KDM6B. To determine if exosomes mediated the transfer of 
miR-138-5p between cancer cells to macrophages, we treated macrophages with 
exosomes collected from the conditioned medium of cancer cells. The effects of 
exosomal miR-138-5p on macrophage polarization were measured using RT-qPCR, flow 
cytometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We employed a mouse model 
of breast cancer, metastatic to the lung, to evaluate the effects on tumor 
metastasis of macrophages treated with miR-138-5p-enriched exosomes. To develop 
a diagnostic evaluation index, the levels of exosomal miR-138-5p in samples from 
patients with breast cancer were compared to those of controls. Results: 
Coculture of breast cancer cells led to downregulation of KDM6B expression in 
macrophages. Cancer cell-derived exosomal miR-138-5p inhibited M1 polarization 
and promoted M2 polarization through inhibition of KDM6B expression in 
macrophages. Macrophages treated with exosomal miR-138-5p promoted lung 
metastasis, and the level of circulating exosomal miR-138-5p positively 
correlated with the progression of breast cancer. Conclusion: Our data suggest 
that miR-138-5p was delivered from breast cancer cells to tumor-associated 
macrophages via exosomes to downregulate KDM6B expression, inhibit M1 
polarization, and stimulate M2 polarization. Therefore, exosomal miR-138-5p 
represents a promising prognostic marker and target for the treatment of breast 
cancer.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), like monoclonal antibodies of PD-1, CTLA-4, 
and their ligands, are effective only in some populations of patients with 
cancer, because the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment (TME) 
in some patients cannot be effectively reversed after ICI therapy. Sialic acid 
(SA) receptors in the Siglec family are highly expressed on the surface of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and most have immunosuppressive effects. 
Therefore, targeting TAMs (the siglec axis) to reverse tumor immunosuppression 
may provide a new direction for the development of novel tumor immunotherapies. 
We designed a Zoledronic acid (ZA)-loaded liposome modified by a 
SA-octadecylamine conjugate (ZA-SL) to act as a novel nanomedicine delivery 
platform. This platform can efficiently deliver ZA to TAMs through the 
combination of SA and Siglec-1 and exerts specific cytotoxicity or phenotypic 
remodeling of M2-like TAMs depending on the drug concentration in TAMs. In vivo 
experiments showed that ZA-SL had good TAM targeting ability, and after 
treatment, the S180 tumors of mice were significantly inhibited, and the 
proportion of M1-like TAMs was significantly higher than that of M2-like TAMs 
with no significant adverse reactions in mice. Therefore, SA-modified ZA-loaded 
liposomes may provide a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid carcinoma (TC) has been a global issue for its rapid 
increasing incidence worldwide. Although most TC was not so aggressive with a 
good prognosis, treatment against anaplastic TC was relatively limited and the 
mechanisms are not well elucidated yet.
METHODS: TC cell lines (IHH4 and TPC-1) were used. Flow cytometry was used to 
identify the surface marker of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from 
cell culture. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot 
analysis, immunostaining, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the 
expression of Wnt1, Wnt3a, components of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and 
proliferation/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Alkaline 
phosphatase activity assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were 
used to examine the roles of Wnt1, Wnt3a, and β-catenin pathway in cell 
dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and invasion of TC cells, 
respectively. Subcutaneous tumor growth was monitored in nude mice.
RESULTS: Coculture with M2-like TAMs facilitated dedifferentiation, 
proliferation, migration, and invasion in TC cells. EMT and 
proliferation-related proteins were also promoted in cocultured TC cells. The 
level of Wnt1 and Wnt3a was increased in the coculture system. Block of Wnt1 or 
Wnt3a suppressed malignant behaviors in cocultured tumor cells. Furthermore, 
Wnt1 or Wnt3a knockdown inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and 
suppressed EMT and proliferation-related signals in cocultured tumor cells. 
Knockdown of Wnt1 or Wnt3a inhibited tumor growth in xenograft model.
CONCLUSION: M2-like TAMs promoted dedifferentiation, proliferation, and 
metastasis of TC by Wnt1 and Wnt3a secretion and ensuing β-catenin activation.

A helpful evaluation system is crucial for the postoperative prognosis 
prediction of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. This study 
determined the prognostic value of combining intratumoral RASSF10 expression and 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with the established clinicopathological 
indicators in ccRCC patients. RASSF10 expression was analyzed in ccRCC patient 
data from online databases and ccRCC cell lines. Two independent ccRCC patient 
cohorts were employed to examine the prognostic value of RASSF10 and other 
markers by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and statistical analyses. We found that 
RASSF10 expression was downregulated in ccRCC specimens from the TCGA datasets 
and three independent institutions. RASSF10 expression was negatively correlated 
with disease progression and TAM infiltration in ccRCC. In addition, low RASSF10 
expression and high TAM infiltration predicted a high TNM stage, SSIGN score, 
WHO/ISUP grading, and a poor prognosis in two independent ccRCC patient cohorts. 
Moreover, RASSF10, CD68 or CD163, TNM stage, and SSIGN score were identified as 
independent risk factors in predicting ccRCC patients' prognosis. Time-dependent 
c-index analyses revealed that the combination of RASSF10 and TAMs resulted in a 
higher index than that resulting from each alone in the postoperative prognosis 
of ccRCC patients, and the integration of RASSF10 and TAMs with the TNM stage or 
SSIGN score achieved the best accuracy in assessing the prognosis of ccRCC 
patients. These findings were validated in the randomized training, validation, 
and combined cohorts. Taken together, the combination of the RASSF10-TAM 
classifier and current clinical parameters yields superior accuracy in 
predicting the ccRCC patients' postoperative outcome.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), with its high recurrence rates, urges 
for reasonable therapeutic strategies that can prolong overall survival. A tumor 
microenvironment (TME) discloses prognostic and prospective information on 
cancer, such as the expression level of PD-1 or PD-L1. However, in HGSOC, the 
impact of the therapies aiming at these targets remains unsatisfying. 
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in HGSOC make up a large part of the TMEs 
and transform between diverse phenotypes under different treatments. AZD5153 
inhibiting BRD4, as a potential therapeutic strategy for HGSOC, was demonstrated 
to confer controversial plasticity on TAMs, which shows the need to uncover its 
impact on TAMs in HGSOC. Therefore, we established models for TAMs and TAMs 
co-culturing with T lymphocytes in vitro. Via RT-PCR and flow cytometry, we find 
that AZD5153 resets TAMs from M2-type macrophages to M1-like macrophages, 
consequently promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and thus activating 
CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro. This modification occurs on MAF 
transcripts in TAMs and modified by BRD4, which is the target of AZD5153. 
Importantly, the 3-D microfluid model demonstrates that AZD5153 sensitizes 
ovarian cancer to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Our results clarify that besides 
eliminating tumor cells directly, AZD5153 works as a regulator of the TAM 
phenotype, providing a novel strategy combining AZD5153 and PD-1/PD-L1 antibody 
that could benefit HGSOC patients.

M2 (tumor-supportive) macrophages may upregulate growth differentiation factor 
15 (GDF15), which is highly expressed in prostate tumors, but the combined 
utility of these markers as prognostic biomarkers are unclear. We 
retrospectively studied 90 prostate cancer cases that underwent radical 
prostatectomy as their primary treatment and were followed for biochemical 
recurrence (BCR). These cases also had a benign prostate biopsy at least 1 year 
or more before their prostate cancer surgery. Using computer algorithms to 
analyze digitalized immunohistochemically stained slides, GDF15 expression and 
the presence of M2 macrophages based on the relative density of CD204- and 
CD68-positive macrophages were measured in prostate: (i) benign biopsy, (ii) 
cancer and (iii) tumor-adjacent benign (TAB) tissue. Both M2 macrophages (P = 
0.0004) and GDF15 (P < 0.0001) showed significant inter-region expression 
differences. Based on a Cox proportional hazards model, GDF15 expression was not 
associated with BCR but, in men where GDF15 expression differences between 
cancer and TAB were highest, the risk of BCR was significantly reduced (hazard 
ratio = 0.26; 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.94). In addition, cases with high 
levels of M2 macrophages in prostate cancer had almost a 5-fold increased risk 
of BCR (P = 0.01). Expression of GDF15 in prostate TAB was associated with M2 
macrophage levels in both prostate cancer and TAB and appeared to moderate 
M2-macrophage-associated BCR risk. In summary, the relationship of GDF15 
expression and CD204-positive M2 macrophage levels is different in a prostate 
tumor environment compared with an earlier benign biopsy and, collectively, 
these markers may predict aggressive disease.

Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) is a member of the JAK family, which plays an essential 
and non-redundant role in tumorigenesis. However, the potential role of JAK1 in 
immune infiltration and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. 
The mRNA expression and methylation level of JAK1 in LUAD were examined using 
the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, respectively. The 
correlations between JAK1 expression and its methylation level and 
clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier plotter database 
was used to evaluate the prognostic value of JAK1 in LUAD. The signaling 
pathways associated with JAK1 expression were identified by performing a GSEA. 
The CIBERSORT and TIMER databases were used to analyze the correlations between 
JAK1 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In addition, the JAK1 expression and 
proportion of immune cells in LUAD cell lines were analyzed. The JAK1 expression 
was remarkably decreased in patients with LUAD and significantly correlated with 
the clinical features of patients with LUAD. The JAK1 methylation level was 
increased and negatively correlated with its mRNA expression. A decrease in JAK1 
expression was correlated with poor prognosis. The results of GSEA showed that 
cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune-related signaling pathways were mainly 
enriched. JAK1 was positively associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
and the results of CIBERSORT analysis suggested that JAK1 was correlated with 
monotypes and M1 macrophages. The results of the TIMER database analysis 
confirmed that JAK1 was closely associated with the gene markers of M1 
macrophages. Thus, JAK1 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in LUAD 
and is associated with immune infiltration.

PURPOSE: Two types of macrophages are present in tumor microenvironment. M1 
macrophages exhibit potent anti-tumor properties, while M2 macrophages play the 
pro-tumoral roles. The presence of M2 macrophages is associated with worsened 
overall survival in triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) patients. However, 
the relationship between M2 macrophages and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC) is unknown.
METHODS: M2 macrophages were investigated on biopsy whole sections from 66 TNBCs 
treated with NAC by CD163 together with other immune checkpoint markers (PD1, 
PD-L1 and CD8) using a multi-color immunohistochemical multiplex assay.
RESULTS: Incomplete response was significantly associated with older age, lower 
PD-L1 expression (tumor and stroma), lower levels of CD8-positive TILs in 
stroma, but higher level of CD163-positive macrophages, with the level of 
CD163-positive M2 macrophages in peritumoral area as the strongest factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data have demonstrated that the level of CD163-positive M2 
macrophages was significantly higher in TNBC patients with incomplete response 
than patients with complete response, suggesting M2 macrophages' important role 
in predicting TNBC patients' response to NAC.

Infiltration of tumor-promoting immune cells is a strong driver of tumor 
progression. Especially the accumulation of macrophages in the tumor 
microenvironment is known to facilitate tumor growth and to correlate with poor 
prognosis in many tumor types. TAp73, a member of the p53/p63/p73 family, acts 
as a tumor suppressor and has been shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis. 
However, what role TAp73 has in regulating immune cell infiltration is unknown. 
Here, we report that low levels of TAp73 correlate with an increased 
NF-κB-regulated inflammatory signature in breast cancer. Furthermore, we show 
that loss of TAp73 results in NF-κB hyperactivation and secretion of Ccl2, a 
known NF-κB target and chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages. 
Importantly, TAp73-deficient tumors display an increased accumulation of 
protumoral macrophages that express the mannose receptor (CD206) and scavenger 
receptor A (CD204) compared to controls. The relevance of TAp73 expression in 
human breast carcinoma was further accentuated by revealing that TAp73 
expression correlates negatively with the accumulation of protumoral CD163+ 
macrophages in breast cancer patient samples. Taken together, our findings 
suggest that TAp73 regulates macrophage accumulation and phenotype in breast 
cancer through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
are heterogeneous cells that share myeloid markers and are not easily 
distinguishable in human tumors due to their lack of specific markers. These 
cells are a major player in the tumor microenvironment and are involved in the 
prognosis and physiopathology of various tumors. Here is presented a scheme to 
decipher these cells by mass cytometry.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is severely affecting the health and 
lives of patients. Clarifying the composition and regulatory factors of tumor 
immune microenvironment (TIME) is helpful for the treatment of PDAC. We analyzed 
the unique TIMEs and gene expression patterns between PDAC and adjacent normal 
tissue (ANT) using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to find new immunotherapy 
targets. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were used to elucidate the 
possible mechanism of which tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) changed in PDAC. 
We found that the composition of TAMs subtypes, including M0, M1, and M2, was 
different between PDAC and ANT, which was validated in recently published 
single-cell RNA-seq data. Many immune cells interacted with each other to affect 
the TIME. There were many DEGs enriched in some pathways that could potentially 
change the immune cell composition. KRT6A was found to be a DEG between PDAC and 
ANT that overlapped with DEGs between the M0-high group and the M0-low group in 
TCGA datasets, and it might alter and regulate TAMs via a collection of genes 
including COL5A2, COL1A2, MIR3606, SPARC, and COL6A3. TAMs, which could be a 
target of immunotherapy, might be influenced by genes through KRT6A and indicate 
an undesirable prognosis in PDAC.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest cancers due to 
its aggressive and metastatic nature. PDA is characterized by a rich tumor 
stroma with abundant macrophages, fibroblasts, and collagen deposition that can 
represent up to 90% of the tumor mass. Activation of the tyrosine kinase 
receptor AXL and expression of its ligand growth arrest-specific protein 6 
(Gas6) correlate with a poor prognosis and increased metastasis in pancreatic 
cancer patients. Gas6 is a multifunctional protein that can be secreted by 
several cell types and regulates multiple processes, including cancer cell 
plasticity, angiogenesis, and immune cell functions. However, the role of Gas6 
in pancreatic cancer metastasis has not been fully investigated. In these 
studies we find that, in pancreatic tumors, Gas6 is mainly produced by tumor 
associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and that 
pharmacological blockade of Gas6 signaling partially reverses 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells and supports NK cell 
activation, thereby inhibiting pancreatic cancer metastasis. Our data suggest 
that Gas6 simultaneously acts on both the tumor cells and the NK cells to 
support pancreatic cancer metastasis. This study supports the rationale for 
targeting Gas6 in pancreatic cancer and use of NK cells as a potential biomarker 
for response to anti-Gas6 therapy.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is the most common pancreatic cancer, with high 
mortality rate and limited treatment options. Tumor infiltrating cells and genes 
in microenvironment are emerging as pivotal players in PAAD progression and 
prognosis. In this study, we obtained genes expression data set GSE119794 of 
PAAD, which contains data from 10 tumor and 10 normal samples. A total of 262 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 169 up-regulated and 93 
down-regulated genes, were obtained based on expression fold change and 
significance. Combining the pathway analysis of DEGs and GSEA analysis of all 
genes, four KEGG pathways were enriched. The 4 pathways include pancreatic 
secretion, protein digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, and 
PPAR signaling pathways. Functional enrichment of Gene Ontology significantly 
enriched extracellular matrix, an important component in microenvironment. In 
the Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we screened out 3 hub genes of 
COL11A1, KRT19 and CXCL5 by CytoHubba. At last, the expression level, prognostic 
significance and correlation with tumor infiltrates were validated in TCGA 
database, with GEPIA and TIMER. The validation identified Collagen Type XI Alpha 
1 Chain (COL11A1), an extracellular matrix structural constituent, as a 
hazardous prognosticator with significant correlation with macrophage, 
neutrophil and dendritic cells. In sum, we identified COL11A1 as an immune 
infiltrates correlated prognosticator in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are functionally defined as the cell subset with 
greater potential to initiate and propagate tumors. Within the heterogeneous 
population of lung CSCs, we previously identified highly disseminating 
CD133+CXCR4+ cells able to initiate distant metastasis (metastasis initiating 
cells-MICs) and to resist conventional chemotherapy. The establishment of an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment by tumor cells is crucial to sustain and 
foster metastasis formation, and CSCs deeply interfere with immune responses 
against tumors. How lung MICs can elude and educate immune cells surveillance to 
efficiently complete the metastasis cascade is, however, currently unknown. We 
show here in primary tumors from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
that MICs express higher levels of immunoregulatory molecules compared to tumor 
bulk, namely PD-L1 and CD73, an ectoenzyme that catalyzes the production of 
immunosuppressive adenosine, suggesting an enhanced ability of MICs to escape 
immune responses. To investigate in vitro the immunosuppressive ability of MICs, 
we derived lung spheroids from cultures of adherent lung cancer cell lines, 
showing enrichment in CD133+CXCR4+MICs, and increased expression of CD73 and 
CD38, an enzyme that also concurs in adenosine production. MICs-enriched 
spheroids release high levels of adenosine and express the immunosuppressive 
cytokine IL-10, undetectable in an adherent cell counterpart. To prevent 
dissemination of MICs, we tested peptide R, a novel CXCR4 inhibitor that 
effectively controls in vitro lung tumor cell migration/invasion. Notably, we 
observed a decreased expression of CD73, CD38, and IL-10 following CXCR4 
inhibition. We also functionally proved that conditioned medium from 
MICs-enriched spheroids compared to adherent cells has an enhanced ability to 
suppress CD8+ T cell activity, increase Treg population, and induce the 
polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which participate in 
suppression of T cells. Treatment of spheroids with anti-CXCR4 rescued T cell 
cytotoxic activity and prevented TAM polarization, likely by causing the 
decrease of adenosine and IL-10 production. Overall, we provide evidence that 
the subset of lung MICs shows high potential to escape immune control and that 
inhibition of CXCR4 can impair both MICs dissemination and their 
immunosuppressive activity, therefore potentially providing a novel therapeutic 
target in combination therapies to improve efficacy of NSCLC treatment.

The metastasis of cervical cancer has always been a clinical challenge. We 
investigated the effects of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) on the epithelial 
mesenchymal transition of cervical cancer cells in vitro as well as its 
influence on macrophage polarization and associated cytokines in vivo. The 
results suggested that LDN supressed the proliferation, migration and invasion 
abilities and promote their apoptosis in Hela cells, whereas the opioid growth 
factor receptor (OGFr) silenced significantly reversed these effects in vitro. 
Knockdown the expression of OGFr, the inhibitory of LDN on EMT was weakened. LDN 
could inhibit cervical cancer progression in nude mice. In additon, LDN 
indirectly reduced the number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), mainly M2 
macrophages, and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in the 
serum of nude mice. These findings demonstrate that LDN could be a potential 
treatment for cervical cancer.

Spontaneous necrosis is a defining feature of glioblastomas (GBMs), the most 
malignant glioma. Despite its strong correlations with poor prognosis, it 
remains unclear whether necrosis could be a possible cause or mere consequence 
of glioma progression. Here we isolated a particular fraction of necrotic 
products spontaneously arising from glioma cells, morphologically and 
biochemically defined as autoschizis-like products (ALPs). When administered to 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-primed bone 
marrow-derived macrophage/dendritic cells (Mφ/DCs), ALPs were found to be 
specifically engulfed by Mφs expressing a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) 
marker CD204. ALPs from glioma stem cells (GSCs) had higher activity for the TAM 
development than those from non-GSCs. Of note, expression of the Il12b gene 
encoding a common subunit of IL-12/23 was upregulated in ALPs-educated Mφs. 
Furthermore, IL-12 protein evidently enhanced the sphere-forming activity of GBM 
patient-derived cells, although interestingly IL-12 is generally recognized as 
an antitumoral M1-Mφ marker. Finally, in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome data of primary and recurrent GBMs revealed that 
higher expression of these IL-12 family genes was well correlated with more 
infiltration of M1-type TAMs and closely associated with poorer prognosis in 
recurrent GBMs. Our results highlight a role of necrosis in GSC-driven 
self-beneficial niche construction and glioma progression, providing important 
clues for developing new therapeutic strategies against gliomas.

Anti-cancer T-cell responses are often halted due to the immune-suppressive 
micro-environment, in part related to tumor-associated macrophages. In the 
current study, we assessed indigestible β-glucans (oatβG, curdlan, grifolan, 
schizophyllan, lentinan, yeast whole glucan particles (yWGP), zymosan and two 
additional yeast-derived β-glucans a and b) for their physicochemical properties 
as well as their effects on the plasticity of human monocyte-derived macrophages 
that were polarized with IL-4 to immune-suppressive macrophages. Beta-glucans 
were LPS/LTA free, and tested for solubility, molecular masses, protein and 
monosaccharide contents. Curdlan, yeast-b and zymosan re-polarized M(IL-4) 
macrophages towards an M1-like phenotype, in particular showing enhanced gene 
expression of CCR7, ICAM1 and CD80, and secretion of TNF-α and IL-6. Notably, 
differential gene expression, pathway analysis as well as protein expressions 
demonstrated that M(IL-4) macrophages treated with curdlan, yeast-b or zymosan 
demonstrated enhanced production of chemo-attractants, such as CCL3, CCL4, and 
CXCL8, which contribute to recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils. The 
secretion of chemo-attractants was confirmed when using patient-derived 
melanoma-infiltrating immune cells. Taken together, the bacterial-derived 
curdlan as well as the yeast-derived β-glucans yeast-b and zymosan have the 
unique ability to preferentially skew macrophages towards a 
chemo-attractant-producing phenotype that may aid in anti-cancer immune 
responses.

Recent advances in immune checkpoint inhibition, which augment T-cell immune 
responses, have highlighted the potential of exploiting one's immune system to 
combat cancer. However, only a relatively small number of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients benefit from immune checkpoint blockade due to the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, combination immunotherapies 
are now being developed to achieve maximal therapeutic benefits. In this study, 
we assessed whether a novel erlotinib derivative, TD-92, which possesses 
anti-tumor effects across several cancer cell lines, could enhance anti-PD-1 
treatment. Our results demonstrated that the combined treatment of anti-PD-1 and 
TD-92 resulted in a potent anti-tumor response in a Lewis lung carcinoma cancer 
model, as evidenced by the reduced tumor growth and increased survival. Analysis 
of immune cell population counts revealed that TD-92 reduced the number of 
pro-tumorigenic CD11b+ F4/80+ tumor-associated macrophages, without 
significantly affecting the total numbers of other major immunocytes. Further 
experiments showed that TD-92 induced a marked decline in colony stimulating 
factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) expression in macrophage cell lines. The results also 
suggested that c-Cbl-mediated proteasome degradation was involved in 
TD-92-mediated CSF-1R downregulation. Our data paves the way for the development 
of additional combination immunotherapies for NSCLC patients.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor progression. The number of 
infiltrating TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) patients; however, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is 
unclear. cDNA microarray analysis indicates that the expression of chemokine 
(C-C motif) ligand 1 (CCL1) is up-regulated in peripheral blood monocyte-derived 
macrophages stimulated using conditioned media from ESCC cells (TAM-like 
macrophages). Here, we evaluated the role of CCL1 in ESCC progression. CCL1 was 
overexpressed in TAM-like macrophages, and CCR8, a CCL1 receptor, was expressed 
on ESCC cell surface. TAM-like macrophages significantly enhanced the motility 
of ESCC cells, and neutralizing antibodies against CCL1 or CCR8 suppressed this 
increased motility. Recombinant human CCL1 promoted ESCC cell motility via the 
Akt/proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. 
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Akt inhibitors, CCR8 silencing, and 
neutralizing antibody against CCR8 could significantly suppress these effects. 
The overexpression of CCL1 in stromal cells or CCR8 in ESCC cells was 
significantly associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.002 or P = 0.009, 
respectively) and disease-free survival (P = 0.009 or P = 0.047, respectively) 
in patients with ESCC. These results indicate that the interaction between 
stromal CCL1 and CCR8 on cancer cells promotes ESCC progression via the 
Akt/proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, 
thereby providing novel therapeutic targets.

Background: Chymase 1 (CMA1), a gene known to be expressed in mast cells (MCs), 
is largely linked to immunity. However, the relationship between CMA1 and 
prognosis of multiple tumours and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) remains 
elusive.Methods: The differential expressions of CMA1 in different tumours and 
their corresponding normal tissues were evaluated via exploring Tumour Immune 
Estimation Resource (TIMER) and Oncomine database; the correlation within 
expression level of CMA1 and outcome of cancer patients was evaluated via 
Kaplan-Meier plotter and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) 
database; the correlation between CMA1 and tumour immune cell infiltration was 
further investigated by TIMER; additionally, the correlation between CMA1 and 
gene signature pattern of immune infiltration were checked using TIMER and 
GEPIA.Results: There were significant differences in CMA1 expression levels 
between gastric cancer (GC) tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The high 
expression of CMA1 was closed related to poor overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with GC (OS HR = 1.50, p = .00015; 
PFS HR = 1.33, p = .016). Especially, in GC patients at N1, N2 and N3 stages, 
high CMA1 expression was correlated with poor OS and PFS, but not with NO 
(p = .15, .09). The expression of CMA1 was positively associated with the levels 
of infiltrated CD4+, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells 
(DCs) in GC. Whereas, CMA1 expression was considerably associated with various 
immune markers.Conclusion: CMA1 is a key gene whose expression level is 
significantly correlated with GC prognosis and infiltration levels of CD8+, CD4+ 
T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and DCs in GC. In addition, the expression of 
CMA1 may be involved in regulating tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), 
dendritic cells, exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells in GC. It suggests 
that CMA1 could be utilized as a prognostic marker and a sign of immune 
infiltration in GC.

Multiple myeloma is a refractory cancer of plasma cells. Although treatment 
strategies for multiple myeloma are getting improved year by year, in most cases 
patients relapse due to the emergence of drug-resistant mutations in the myeloma 
cells. The interplay between myeloma cells and tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAM) is important for the pathology. We thought that some heptamer-type sgRNAs 
for TRUE gene silencing would be able to transform TAM toward the M1 state and 
might become therapeutic drugs for myeloma. Here, we searched for heptamer-type 
sgRNAs that can shift macrophages toward the M1 state. We screened a 
heptamer-type sgRNA library for the ability to up-regulate IL-12b gene 
expression in human macrophage-like cell lines, and found three such sgRNAs. One 
of the sgRNAs, H12960, which also showed such ability in human fresh macrophages 
and mouse macrophage-like cell lines, efficiently suppressed human myeloma cell 
growth in SCID/NOD mice.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of most important components of the 
tumor microenvironment. Although many assays have been developed to 
differentiate monocytes into macrophages (Mϕ) for studying the biology of TAMs 
in vitro, little is known whether the macrophages induced by these approaches 
can recapitulate the biology of TAMs present in the tumor microenvironment. We 
have developed a novel assay to differentiate human monocytes into TAMs using 
modified melanoma-conditioned medium, which is derived from the concentrated 
tumor cell culture medium. Characterization of these modified 
melanoma-conditioned medium-induced macrophages (MCMI-Mϕ) by multiple flow 
cytometry, Luminex, microarray, and immunohistochemistry analyses indicates that 
MCMI-Mϕ are phenotypically and functionally highly similar to the TAMs present 
in the tumor microenvironment.

AIMS: Cetuximab improves the survival of patients with advanced colorectal 
cancer (CRC). However, how cetuximab affects the tumor microenvironment has not 
been sufficiently understood. This study was to investigate whether cetuximab 
could inhibit the pro-tumor function of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) by 
suppressing the EGFR/IL-6 pathway.
MAIN METHODS: The azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) and tumor 
xenograft mouse models were used to assess the effect of cetuximab on TAMs. Flow 
cytometry, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and ELISA were used to assess the 
prevalence of M2 and M1 phenotypes. Publicly available datasets of CRC patients 
were used to assess the relevance of EGFR and IL-6 expression as prognostic 
indicators.
KEY FINDINGS: The two mouse models showed that cetuximab could attenuate the 
pro-tumor function of TAMs and decrease tumor burden. Cetuximab repolarized TAMs 
from M2-like to M1-like phenotypes, mainly by suppressing the IL-6 expression 
through NFκB and STAT3 pathways. Analysis of public scRNA-seq data indicated 
EGFR was mainly expressed on the surface of macrophage infiltration into tumor 
microenvironment. The public transcriptomics datasets showed that the expression 
level of IL-6 was positively correlated with EGFR in CRC patients, and 
PROGgeneV2 analysis indicated that IL-6 and CD206 both predicted poor 
recurrence-free and overall survival of CRC patients. Furthermore, the 
inhibition efficacy of cetuximab was significantly attenuated in IL-6 knockout 
CRC mice model.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate a new macrophage-based molecular mechanism 
explaining the effect of cetuximab in treatment of colorectal cancer.

The aim of this study was to determine the polarization of macrophages in the 
tumor microenvironment, as well as the effect of soluble factors secreted from 
these polarized macrophages on etoposide-induced cancer cell apoptosis. We 
investigated the effect of soluble factors secreted from the supernatant of PC3 
cells treated with TLR4 and TLR8 agonists, and etoposide on macrophage 
polarization at the protein level through flow cytometry and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. We further explored the cell cycle distribution and 
phagocytic activity of THP-1 cells by flow cytometry. To imitate the 
relationship between cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), we 
cocultured macrophages with etoposide-treated PC3 cells. After the incubation, 
the apoptosis in cancer cells was assessed through FACS analysis and by annexin 
V and PI staining. Our results demonstrate that protein expression of M1 and M2 
markers confirmed the upregulation of M1 markers upon etoposide treatment, and 
mixed M1/M2 phenotype upon treatment with TLR agonists-treated PC3 supernatant. 
In coculture methods, our results demonstrate that the apoptosis of 
etoposide-treated cancer cells increases in the presence of M0 macrophages and 
THP-1 cells incubated with the supernatant of TLR4 agonists-treated PC3 cells. 
These results indicate clear protective effects of M0 macrophages and THP-1 
cells incubated with the supernatant of PC3 cells treated with TLR4 agonists 
(THP-1 + SUP +  TLR4a) on etoposide-induced cancer cell apoptosis.

Docking protein 3 has been implicated in immune response, including interferon-β 
production in macrophage and plasma cell differentiation. And its importance in 
lung adenocarcinoma has been reported. However, studies about its role in 
gliomas are rare. In this study, we explored the clinical and prognostic 
characteristics of DOK3 expression in 921 glioma samples. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis and Cox regression analysis verified the independent unfavorable 
prognostic value and high prognostic accuracy of DOK3 expression for overall 
survival. Functional analysis with Database for Annotation, Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) implied the 
involvement of DOK3 in immune related responses. Immune cell infiltration 
analysis with online tools, CIBERSORT and EPIC, showed that samples with higher 
DOK3 expression were infiltrated with much more macrophages. DOK3 was also found 
to be strongly positively correlated with marker genes of tumor-associated 
macrophages and M2 macrophages, not M1. Results of immunohistochemical staining 
also demonstrated that samples with higher DOK3 expression level were 
infiltrated with more microglia/macrophages and immunosuppressive M2 
macrophages. In summary, our results demonstrated the correlation between high 
DOK3 expression level and malignant progression of gliomas, and the possible 
involvement of DOK3 in immunosuppressive responses in gliomas.

OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer can spread in numerous ways, one of which has been 
suggested to be spread through air spaces (STAS). The tumor immune 
microenvironment appears to play a significant role in this spread. 
Particularly, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can create a favorable 
microenvironment for tumor progression. In this study, we analyzed data from 709 
patients with stage 0-IIIA lung adenocarcinoma, resected between 1999 and 2016, 
and investigated whether immune cell infiltration was associated with the 
occurrence of STAS and clinical outcome of the disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays were constructed, and 
immunohistochemical analysis was performed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CD25, 
CD20, and CD68. The three tumor areas with the highest density of immune cells 
were photographed, and the immune cells were quantified. Associations between 
variables were analyzed using chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. 
Recurrence-free probability and overall survival were analyzed using log-rank 
tests and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: After analyzing the associations between STAS and each type of immune 
cell infiltration, high density of CD68 + TAMs was identified as an independent 
predictor of a high STAS rate (p =  0.014) and was found to be associated with a 
high risk of recurrence, using univariate analysis (p =  0.008). After adjusting 
for CD68+ TAMs, pathological stage, and lymphovascular invasion, STAS remained 
significantly associated with a high risk of recurrence (HR = 3.50, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that a high density of CD68 + TAMs is an independent 
predictor of an increased STAS rate. Additionally, STAS is correlated with 
aggressive tumor behavior characteristics.

T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) has been suggested to be a 
critical immune checkpoint target for cancer immunotherapy. However, limited 
progress with Tim-3 immunotherapy has been achieved over the last decade due to 
the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have 
successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect 
different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins 
ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect 
only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity 
uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes 
with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated 
macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The 
membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant 
roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. 
The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an 
ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential 
clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the relationship between tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) and solid tumors has become a research hotspot. This study 
aims to explore the close relationship of TAMs with metabolic reprogramming 
genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to provide new methods of treatment for 
HCC.
METHODS: The study selected 343 HCC patients with complete survival information 
(survival time > = 1 month) in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as study subjects. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assisted in determining the relationship between 
macrophage infiltration and overall survival (OS), and Pearson correlation tests 
were used to identify metabolic reprogramming genes (MRGs) associated with tumor 
macrophage abundance. Lasso regression algorithms were used on prognosis-related 
MRGs identified by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox regression 
analysis to construct a risk score; another independent cohort (including 228 
HCC patients) from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was used to 
verify prognostic signature externally.
RESULTS: A risk score composed of 8 metabolic genes could accurately predict the 
OS of a training cohort (TCGA) and a testing cohort (ICGC). The risk score could 
be widely used for people with different clinical characteristics, and it is a 
predictor that is independent of other clinical factors that affect prognosis. 
As expected, compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group exhibited an 
obviously higher macrophage abundance, together with a positive correlation 
between the risk score and the expression levels of three commonly used immune 
checkpoints (PD1, PDL1, and CTLA4).
CONCLUSION: Our study constructed and validated a novel eight-gene signature for 
predicting HCC patient OS, which may contribute to clinical treatment decisions.

Jian-pi-yang-zheng Decoction (JPYZ) is a traditional Chinese medicine that is 
used for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, and it shows good efficacy in 
patients. A previous study indicated that JPYZ inhibited the progression of 
gastric cancer via the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), but 
the underlying molecular target of JPYZ regulation of TAMs has not been 
determined. The present study used modified-JPYZ (mJPYZ) to extend our 
investigation of gastric cancer. Our results showed that mJPYZ inhibited gastric 
cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. We found that mJPYZ decreased the 
activity of PI3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) in TAMs, reduced the anti-inflammatory factor 
IL-10 and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α 
and IL-1β, which ultimately promoted the conversion of TAMs from M2 to M1. Our 
findings also indicated that mJPYZ inhibited the growth and metastasis of 
gastric cancer by alleviating the unfavorable differentiation of TAMs via the 
PI3Kγ signaling cascades. In conclusion, the present findings indicated that 
mJPYZ inhibited gastric cancer cell EMT via PI3Kγ-dependent TAM reprogramming, 
which eventually suppressed gastric cancer growth and metastasis. Our study 
provides an underlying mechanism of a Chinese medicine in the treatment of 
gastric cancer via PI3Kγ in macrophages.

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are acid-base regulatory proteins that modulate a 
variety of physiological functions. Recent findings have shown that CAIX is 
particularly upregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is associated with 
a poor patient outcome and survival rate. An analysis of the GSE4290 dataset of 
patients with gliomas showed that CAIX was highly expressed in GBM and was 
negatively associated with prognosis. The expression of CAIX under hypoxic 
conditions in GBM significantly increased in protein, mRNA, and transcriptional 
activity. Importantly, CAIX upregulation also regulated GBM motility, monocyte 
adhesion to GBM, and the polarization of tumor-associated monocytes/macrophages 
(TAM). Furthermore, the overexpression of CAIX was observed in intracranial GBM 
cells. Additionally, epidermal growth factor receptor/signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 regulated CAIX expression under hypoxic conditions 
by affecting the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. In contrast, the 
knockdown of CAIX dramatically abrogated the change in GBM motility and monocyte 
adhesion to GBM under hypoxic conditions. Our results provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the mechanisms of CAIX in the GBM microenvironment. Hence, 
novel therapeutic targets of GBM progression are possibly developed.

EGFR TKI therapy has become a first-line regimen for non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients with EGRF mutations. However, there are two big challenges 
against effective therapy--the secondary EGFR mutation-associated TKI resistance 
and brain metastasis (BMs) of lung cancer. The BMs is a major cause of death for 
advanced NSCLC patients, and the treatment of BMs with TKI resistance remains 
difficult. Methods: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is a promising drug 
target for inhibiting tumor growth, overcoming drug resistance, and 
anti-metastasis. TAM also plays an essential role in regulating tumor 
microenvironment. We developed a dual-targeting liposomal system with 
modification of anti-PD-L1 nanobody and transferrin receptor (TfR)-binding 
peptide T12 for codelivery of simvastatin/gefitinib to treat BMs of NSCLC. 
Results: The dual-targeting liposomes could efficiently penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the BMs, acting on TAM repolarization and 
reversal of EGFRT790M-associated drug resistance. The treatment mechanisms were 
related to the elevating ROS and the suppression of the EGFR/Akt/Erk signaling 
pathway. Conclusion: The dual-targeting liposomal codelivery system offers a 
promising strategy for treating the advanced EGFRT790M NSCLC patients with BMs.

Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key components of the cancer 
microenvironment. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between 
TAMs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: All studies investigating 
macrophages in HCC from January 2008 to May 2018 were retrieved by searching the 
Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and 
Wanfang databases. The associations of TAMs with overall survival (OS), 
disease-free survival (DFS) and the corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) or odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for analysis. 
Heterogeneity was assessed by using the Q test and I2 statistic. Statistical 
analyses were performed with Stata 13.0. Results: Seventeen articles with a 
total of 3547 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analysis 
showed that a high density of M2 TAMs in intratumor (IT) was significantly 
correlated with OS (HR = 1.58, 95%CI = 1.15-2.00), and the subgroup analysis 
suggested the significant difference in CD206+M2 TAMs (HR = 1.74, 
95%CI = 1.26-2.21). However, the high expression levels of CD68+M1 TAMs in the 
IT or peritumor (PT) were not related with OS (CD68 in IT:HR = 1.30, 
95%CI = 0.88-1.72;CD68 in PT:HR = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.93-1.85). Furthermore, a high 
density of CD206+M2 TAMs in IT showed a significant association with vascular 
invasion (OR = 2.18, 95%CI = 1.38-3.44) and more advanced TNM stage (OR = 2.38, 
95%CI = 1.12-5.07). Conclusions: CD68+M1 TAMs have no prognostic effects on OS.A 
high density of M2 TAMs in IT is associated with poor prognosis in HCC, and 
CD206+ M2 TAMs can be used as a prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, the limit 
sample sizes might cause potential publication bias, thus more trails on CD206 
are needed.

Patients with grade III anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) separate into survival 
cohorts based on the presence or absence of mutations in isocitrate 
dehydrogenase (IDH). Progression to glioblastoma (GBM), morphologically 
distinguishable by elevated microvascular proliferation, necrosis, and cell 
division in tumor tissues, is considerably more rapid in IDH wild-type tumors 
such that their diagnosis as AA is relatively rare. More often initially 
presenting as GBM, these contain higher numbers of tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) than most AA, and GBM patients also have higher levels of circulating M2 
monocytes. TAM and M2 monocytes share functional properties inhibitory for 
antitumor immunity. Yet, although there is a wealth of data implicating TAM in 
tumor-immune evasion, there has been limited analysis of the impact of the 
circulating M2 monocytes. In the current study, immune parameters in sera, 
circulating cells, and tumor tissues from patients with primary gliomas 
morphologically diagnosed as AA were assessed. Profound differences in serum 
cytokines, glioma extracellular vesicle cross-reactive Abs, and gene expression 
by circulating cells identified two distinct patient cohorts. Evidence of type 
2-immune bias was most often seen in patients with IDH wild-type AA, whereas a 
type 1 bias was common in patients with tumors expressing the IDH1R132H 
mutation. Nevertheless, a patient's immune profile was better correlated with 
the extent of tumor vascular enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging than IDH 
mutational status. Regardless of IDH genotype, AA progression appears to be 
associated with a switch in systemic immune bias from type 1 to type 2 and the 
loss of tumor vasculature integrity.

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among females and the second most 
common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are 
the most abundant immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment, 
including breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) play an important role 
in regulating breast cancer growth and metastasis, which still remains an 
obstacle for successful treatment of breast cancer and requires further 
investigation, as well as the potential therapeutic strategies. Cytokine array 
validated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) is a pivotal chemokine 
secreted by TAMs, and CXCL8 could enhance breast cancer migration, invasion 
ability, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both animal and human 
breast cancer. In this study, the clinical data firstly indicated that high 
CXCL8 expression was significantly associated with metastasis and tumor growth 
in breast cancer patients. Then, we showed that TAMs-released CXCL8 could 
markedly elevate the migration, invasion and EMT events in breast cancer cells, 
as well as the self-renewal of BCSCs in vitro. These processes were markedly 
abrogated by the treatment of Danirixin, a reversible and selective antagonist 
of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). Consistently, the in vivo analysis 
confirmed that CXCL8 suppression using Danirixin effectively reduced the tumor 
growth, lung metastasis and repressed the self-renewal of BCSCs. Collectively, 
TAMs/CXCL8 could enhance BCSCs self-renewal and breast cancer metastasis, and 
these effects could be markedly abolished by Danirixin treatment, suppressing 
breast cancer progression consequently. Therefore, Danirixin could be considered 
as a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment 
without obvious toxicity to major organs.

Although the pathological significance of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) 
heterogeneity is still poorly understood, TAM reprogramming is viewed as a 
promising anticancer therapy. Here we show that a distinct subset of TAMs 
(F4/80hiCD115hiC3aRhiCD88hi), endowed with high rates of heme catabolism by the 
stress-responsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), plays a critical role in 
shaping a prometastatic tumor microenvironment favoring immunosuppression, 
angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This population 
originates from F4/80+HO-1+ bone marrow (BM) precursors, accumulates in the 
blood of tumor bearers and preferentially localizes at the invasive margin 
through a mechanism dependent on the activation of Nrf2 and coordinated by the 
NF-κB1-CSF1R-C3aR axis. Inhibition of F4/80+HO-1+ TAM recruitment or 
myeloid-specific deletion of HO-1 blocks metastasis formation and improves 
anticancer immunotherapy. Relative expression of HO-1 in peripheral monocyte 
subsets, as well as in tumor lesions, discriminates survival among metastatic 
melanoma patients. Overall, these results identify a distinct cancer-induced 
HO-1+ myeloid subgroup as a new antimetastatic target and prognostic blood 
marker.

In contrast to other solid tumors within the abdominal cavity, epithelial 
ovarian cancers (EOCs) tend to undergo peritoneal metastasis. Thus, the 
peritoneal immune microenvironment is crucial for EOC progression. Previous 
reports indicate that the main immune cells within the peritoneum are M2 
macrophages, specifically tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The communication 
between TAMs and tumor cells plays an important role in EOC development, and 
exosomes, acting as micro-message carriers, occupy an essential position in this 
process. Microarray analyses of exosomes revealed that miR-221-3p was enriched 
in M2 exosomes. Furthermore, miR-221-3p suppressed cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) directly. Thus, miR-221-3p contributed to the 
proliferation and G1/S transition of EOC cells. Additionally, low levels of 
CDKN1B were associated with EOC progression and poor prognosis. These 
observations suggest that TAMs-derived exosomal miR-221-3p acts as a regulator 
of EOC progression by targeting CDKN1B. The results of this study confirm that 
certain exosomal microRNAs may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for EOC.

PURPOSE: Emerging evidence has shown that macrophages (Mφs) at different tumor 
sites have diverse clinical attributes. Stabilin-1 is a multi-functional 
scavenger marker for specialized tumor-associated Mφs. This study investigates 
the relationship between the density and microlocalization of stabilin-1+ Mφs 
within tumors and the clinical outcomes of patients with urothelial carcinoma of 
the bladder (UCB).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 283 UCB patients who received radical 
cystectomy or transurethral resection were examined. Immunohistochemistry and 
immunofluorescence analyses were used to colocalize the expression of stabilin-1 
with other markers for Mφs (CD14, CD68, CD163, and CD206). Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).
RESULTS: In UCB tissues, stabilin-1 was primarily expressed on Mφs, as evident 
from triple immunofluorescence staining for stabilin-1 and Mφ markers. 
Stabilin-1+ Mφs were often more prominent in stromal regions rather than 
intratumoral regions in UCB tissues (P < 0.0001). After dichotomization at the 
median cell density for stabilin-1+ Mφs, only intratumoral stabilin-1+ Mφ 
density was a predictor of poor OS (P < 0.001) and RFS (P = 0.026). Moreover, 
intratumoral stabilin-1+ Mφ density was positively associated with tumor stage 
(P < 0.01) and histological grade (P < 0.01), and emerged as an independent 
prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.371; P < 0.0001), but not for RFS (HR 1.491; 
P = 0.061).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that intratumoral stabilin-1+ Mφs could 
potentially be used as a pro-tumoral prognostic marker for UCB patients.

Colorectal cancer is a devastating disease with a low 5-year survival rate. 
Recently, many researchers have studied the mechanisms of tumor progression 
related to the tumor microenvironment. Here, we addressed the prognostic value 
of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) using a total of 232 CRC patient tissue 
samples and investigated the mechanisms underlying TAM-related colon cancer 
progression with respect to PI3Kγ regulation using in vitro, in vivo, and ex 
vivo approaches. Patients with M2/M1 < 3 had significantly improved 
progression-free survival and overall survival compared with patients with 
M2/M1 > 3. M1 and M2 macrophages elicited opposite effects on colon cancer 
progression via the FBW7-MCL-1 axis. Blocking macrophage PI3Kγ had cytotoxic 
effects on colon cancer cells and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
features by regulating the FBW7-MCL-1 axis. The results of this study suggest 
that macrophage PI3Kγ may be a promising target for immunotherapy in colon 
cancer.

Most cancers contain abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs usually 
display a tumor-supportive M2-like phenotype; they promote tumor growth and 
influence lymphocyte infiltration, leading to immunosuppression. These 
properties have made TAMs an attractive cancer immunotherapy target. One 
promising immunotherapeutic strategy involves switching the tumor-promoting 
immune suppressive microenvironment by reprogramming TAMs. However, clinical 
trials of M2-like macrophage reprogramming have yielded unsatisfactory results 
due to their low efficacy and nonselective effects. In this article, we describe 
the development of M2-like macrophage-targeting nanoparticles (PNP@R@M-T) that 
efficiently and selectively deliver drugs to 58% of M2-like macrophages, over 
39% of M1-like macrophages, and 32% of dendritic cells within 24 h in vivo. 
Compared with the control groups, administration of PNP@R@M-T dramatically 
reprogrammed the M2-like macrophages (51%), reduced tumor size (82%), and 
prolonged survival. Our findings indicate that PNP@R@M-T nanoparticles provide 
an effective and selective reprogramming strategy for macrophage-mediated cancer 
immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90s) family is composed of molecular 
chaperones composed of four isoforms in humans, which has been widely reported 
as unregulated in various kinds of cancers. Nevertheless, the role of each 
HSP90s isoform in prognosis and immune infiltration in distinct subtypes of 
breast cancer (BRAC) remains unclear.
METHODS: Public online databases including the Oncomine, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier 
Plotter, Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling 
Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), GeneMANIA, and Database for Annotation, 
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) were integrated to perform 
bioinformatic analyses and to explore the possible associations among HSP90s 
gene expression, prognosis, and immune infiltration in BRAC.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression of all HSP90s members was elevated in distinct 
clinical stages and subtypes of BRAC, compared with the normal breast tissue (P 
< 0.05). Overexpressed HSP90AA1 was associated with poor prognosis, 
particularly, both short overall survival (OS) and release-free survival (RFS) 
in Basal-like BRAC patients; overexpressed HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 were both 
associated with poor RFS in Luminal A BRAC patients, while overexpressed TRAP1 
was associated with favorable RFS in Luminal A BRAC patients. Moreover, HSP90s 
gene expression in BRAC showed correlations with the infiltration of CD8+ T 
cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), as well as the 
activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), DCs, and CD4+ helper T (Th) 
cells. The underlying mechanisms of HSP90s modulating tumor-infiltrating immune 
cells (TIICs) might be related with their functions in antigen processing and 
presentation, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding, and assisting 
client proteins.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that HSP90s family genes were overexpressed 
and might be serve as prognostic biomarkers in subtypes of BRAC. It might be a 
novel breakthrough point of BRAC treatment to regulate immune infiltration in 
BRAC microenvironment for more effective anticancer immunity through 
pharmacological intervention of HSP90s.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The tumour microenvironment is rich in multiple cells that 
influence cancer development. Among them, macrophages are the most abundant 
immune cells, which secrete factors involved in carcinogenesis. Since 
protein-bound polysaccharides (PBP) from the Coriolus versicolor fungus are 
believed to inhibit the growth of cancers, in the present study, we investigated 
whether these PBP influence crosstalk between triple-negative 4T1 breast cancer 
cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages.
METHODS: 4T1 cells were cultured in conditioned media (CM) collected after: 
stimulation of the macrophages with PBP (CM-PBP) or incubation of non-treated 
macrophages (CM-NT). A co-cultured model of both cell lines was also employed to 
investigate the crosstalk between the cells. Cell viability was measured using 
the MTT assay. The levels of cytokines and chemokines were determined by ELISA 
methods. Commercial assay kits were used to assess the activity of both arginase 
1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the level of cell migration.
RESULTS: The results revealed that CM-NT promotes proliferation and migration of 
4T1 cells, and increases the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, MCP-1) 
by cancer cells. In contrast, CM-PBP inhibits 4T1 cell growth and migration, 
decreases the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, MCP-1) and upregulates 
the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α) with certain 
anti-tumoral properties Moreover, PBP-treated CM significantly decreases the 
level of M2 macrophage markers (arginase 1 activity, IL-10 and TGF-β 
concentrations), but upregulates iNOS activity and IL-6 and TNF-α production, 
which are M1 cell markers.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PBP suppress the favourable tumour 
microenvironment by inhibiting the crosstalk between 4T1 cells and macrophages 
through the regulation of production of angiogenic and inflammatory mediators, 
and modulating the M1/M2 macrophage subtype.

OBJECTIVE: Pre-clinical studies have identified marker- and tumor 
compartment-defined functionally distinct macrophage subsets. Our study analyzes 
marker-defined macrophage subsets in different tumor compartments of high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer (HGSC).
METHODS: A discovery cohort (N = 113) was subjected to immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) analyses. CD68-positivity was confirmed for CD11c-, CD80- and 
CD163-positive cells. Subset-marker-positive cells were scored in the total 
tumor and in four tumor compartments. Correlation analyses investigated 
co-expression of subsets, relationship to CD8+ cells and survival associations. 
A validation cohort (N = 121) was used to confirm selected findings from the 
discovery cohort.
RESULTS: CD163-positve cells was the most abundant subtype in all compartments. 
CD11c and CD163 subsets were strongly correlated with each other in stroma and 
epithelial areas, whereas CD80 and CD163 were correlated in epithelial areas. 
CD80 and CD11c in perivascular areas showed low correlations. Strong 
associations were detected between CD8 and CD80 in the tumor 
epithelium-dominated areas, and between CD8 and CD11c in stroma areas. High 
stromal CD11c density was associated with a longer median overall survival in 
the discovery cohort (HR 0.39; CI 95%, 0.23-0.68; p = 0.001) and in the 
validation cohort (HR 0.46; CI 95%, 0.22-0.93; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the existence of clinically relevant marker- and 
localization defined macrophage subsets in HGSC, which are independently 
regulated. Moreover, it suggests stromal CD11c as a novel prognostic marker in 
HGSC.

B7-H3 is an immune checkpoint molecule from the B7 superfamily. It has been 
widely studied in tumor immune evasion in certain types of cancer. In our 
preliminary study, we found that B7-H3 is specifically enriched in 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
patients and strongly correlated with poor clinical prognosis. However, the role 
of B7-H3 in breast cancer remains elusive. Our current study aims to explore the 
potential of B7-H3 as a novel target in TNBC therapy. Here, we demonstrated that 
B7-H3 enriched on TAMs is tightly correlated with TNBC clinical progression. 
B7-H3high TAMs exhibit great pro-metastatic and immunosuppressive functions by 
intriguing extracellular matrix (ECM) reconstruction and tumor angiogenesis, 
therefore helping tumor cell dissemination and dampening T-cell infiltration in 
tumor microenvironment (TME). Importantly, targeting blockade of B7-H3 by 
anti-B7-H3 antibody improves the tumor vasculature disorder, thereby enhancing 
chemotherapy and PD-1 therapy efficacy. In conclusion, our study establishes the 
correlation between B7-H3high TAMs and TNBC progression for the first time. By 
exploring the possibility of targeting B7-H3 expressed in both tumor cells and 
TAMs, we suggest that B7-H3 could be a promising target in clinical TNBC 
treatment.

Primary esophageal small cell carcinoma (PESCC) is a weakly prevalent but lethal 
malignancy with early metastasis and a poor prognosis. Currently, neither 
effective prognostic indicators nor curative therapies are available for PESCC. 
Immunotherapy has now evolved into one of the most promising therapies for 
cancer patients. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells which are integral to the tumor 
immune microenvironment (TIME) are recognized as highly important for prognosis 
prediction, while the responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade may be 
subject to the features of TIME. In this study, we aim to identify the TIME and 
provide indication for the applicability of immune checkpoint therapy in PESCC. 
We found that PD-L1 expression was detected in 33.33% (27/81) of all the 
patients, mostly exhibiting a stroma-only pattern and that it was positively 
associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD4+, CD8+, and CD163+). In 
74.07% of PD-L1-positive specimens, PD-L1+CD163+ cells were colocalized more 
with CD4+ than CD8+ T cells. 83.95% (68/81) of all the specimens were 
infiltrated with more CD4+ than CD8+ T cells. Further analysis showed FoxP3+ 
Tregs constituted 13-27% of the total CD4+ T cell population. The Kaplan--Meier 
analysis indicated several factors that contribute to poor survival, including 
negative PD-L1 expression, rich CD4 expression, rich FoxP3 expression, a low 
CD8/CD4 ratio, and a high FoxP3/CD8 ratio. A nomogram model was constructed and 
showed good performance for survival prediction. These results highlight that a 
suppressive TIME contributes to poor survival of patients with PESCC. TIME 
analyses might be a promising approach to evaluate the possibility and effect of 
immune checkpoint-based immunotherapeutics in PESCC patients.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been involved in growth and metastases 
of human and canine mammary tumors. However, the prognostic importance of TAM 
specific location in canine mammary tumors (CMT) was not evaluated. In this 
study, we evaluated the potential role of TAMs in specific histologic locations 
- intratumoral (iTAM) and stromal (sTAM), as well as total macrophage (tTAM) 
counts - as prognostic indicators in CMT. Clinicopathologic data from 66 animals 
with mammary carcinoma and their tumors were used in this study. Samples were 
stained with anti-macrophage antibody for subsequent TAM count. High levels of 
iTAM, sTAM, and tTAM were related with advanced clinical stage and vascular 
invasion. Additionally, tTAM revealed a relation with larger tumor size, while 
high levels of sTAM and tTAM were also correlated with node metastasis and a 
poor prognosis based on survival analysis. CMT with aggressive features can 
reveal higher TAM counts. TAMs are associated with vascular invasion and nodal 
metastasis, and sTAM and tTAM counts are correlated with overall survival, 
suggesting they could be used as prognostic indicators in canine mammary 
carcinomas.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy induces metastasis of residual breast cancers through 
activation of tumor-associated macrophages. Previous studies have indicated that 
calcium channel blockers (CCBs) exert anti-inflammatory and antimigratory 
effects on macrophages via attenuating Ca2+ entry into macrophages. However, no 
existing empirical research has addressed the relationship between previous CCB 
use and breast cancer recurrence. In this study, 4840 Taiwanese women aged 
≥20 years with breast cancer who underwent breast surgery from January 1, 2007, 
to December 31, 2015, were enrolled. The date of cancer recurrence was defined 
as the index date. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the 
relationship between previous CCB exposure and cancer recurrence among female 
patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer. After adjusting for 
demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and tumor-node-metastasis stage, the 
adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CCB exposure within 5 years before the index date 
in women with recurrence compared with nonrecurrent controls was 0.73 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.97). Further analysis revealed that the 
adjusted OR for CCB exposure between the surgery and index dates in women with 
recurrence relative to nonrecurrent controls was 0.72 (95%CI, 0.66-0.95). In 
particular, prior CCB use was significantly associated with a lower risk (34%) 
of breast cancer recurrence among women 20 to 54 years old (OR, 0.66; 95%CI, 
0.47-0.83). This study uncovered a protective association between previous CCB 
use and breast cancer recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Although immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has 
become a standard therapeutic strategy in colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibiting 
microsatellite instability-high, limited patients benefit from this new 
approach. To increase the efficacy of ICIs in CRC patients, it is crucial to 
control the function of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. 
M2-tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key immunosuppressive cells and 
promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In 
the present study, we focused on the VEGF signaling pathway in M2-TAMs to 
control their inhibitory function.
METHODS: We evaluated the population of M2-TAMs, the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) 
expression on M2-TAMs, and the correlation between HIF-1α-positive cells and 
VEGFR2 expression levels on M2-TAMs in CRC using the analysis of The Cancer 
Genome Atlas colorectal adenocarcinoma dataset (n = 592), the flow cytometry of 
freshly resected surgical specimens of CRC (n = 20), and the immunofluorescence 
staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded whole tissue samples of CRC 
(n = 20). Furthermore, we performed a functional assay of M2 macrophages through 
the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway in vitro.
RESULTS: The population of M2-TAMs and their VEGFR2 expression significantly 
increased in the tumor compared to the normal mucosa in the CRC patients. 
HIF1-α-positive cells significantly correlated with the VEGFR2 expression level 
of M2-TAMs. M2 macrophages induced by cytokines in vitro produced TGF-β1 through 
the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that anti-VEGFR2 therapy may have therapeutic 
potential to control the immune inhibitory functions of M2-TAMs in CRC, 
resulting in enhanced efficacy of immunotherapy with ICIs.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in tumor 
progression. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been reported to promote 
proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. 
Furthermore, angiogenesis has been reported to induce chemoresistance due to the 
inefficient distribution of drugs to cancer cells. However, the impact of TAMs 
on chemoresistance via angiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. 
The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of TAMs on the chemotherapeutic 
outcome in CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 54 patients who underwent chemotherapy for 
unresectable metastatic CRC after resection of the primary tumor. We evaluated 
the density of TAMs and the degree of angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry and 
then explored the correlation between the density of TAMs and chemotherapeutic 
outcome. Furthermore, we assessed any correlation between the density of TAMs 
and that of neovascularity.
RESULTS: The high-TAMs group had a significantly worse progression-free survival 
(p=0.0006) and a poorer response rate (p=0.0274) than the low-TAMs group. In 
addition, a positive correlation was observed between the density of TAMs and 
the degree of neovascularity (r=0.665, p=0.0004).
CONCLUSION: TAMs were shown to promote chemoresistance via angiogenesis in CRC.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), primarily the M2 phenotype, are involved in 
the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cuban brown propolis 
(Cp) and its main component Nemorosone (Nem) displays an antiproliferative 
effect on different cancer cells, including CRC cell lines. However, whether Cp 
and Nem could exploit its effect on CRC cells by targeting their relationship 
with TAMs remains to be elucidated. In this study, we differentiated the human 
monocytic THP-1 cells to M2 macrophages and confirmed this transition by 
immunofluorescence (IF) staining, qRT-PCR and zymography. An MTT assay was 
performed to determine the effect of Cp and Nem on the viability of CRC HT-29 
cells co-cultured with M2 macrophages. Furthermore, the migration and invasion 
abilities of HT-29 cells were determined by Transwell assays and the expression 
levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were analyzed by IF 
staining. We demonstrated that Cp and Nem reduced the viability of M2 
macrophages and, accordingly, the activity of the MMP-9 metalloprotein. 
Moreover, we demonstrated that M2 macrophages produce soluble factors that 
positively regulate HT-29 cell growth, migration and invasion. These M2-mediated 
effects were counteracted by Cp and Nem treatments, which also played a role in 
regulating the expression of the EMT markers E-cadherin and vimentin. Taken 
together, our results indicate that Nem contained in Cp interferes in the 
crosstalk between CRC cells and TAMs, by targeting M2 macrophages.

Macrophages are critical mediators of tissue homeostasis, cell proliferation, 
and tumor metastasis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are generally 
associated with tumor-promoting immunosuppressive functions in solid tumors. 
Here, we examined the transcriptional landscape of adaptor molecules downstream 
of Toll-like receptors in human cancers and found that higher expression of 
MYD88 correlated with tumor progression. In murine melanoma, MyD88, but not 
Trif, was essential for tumor progression, angiogenesis, and maintaining the 
immunosuppressive phenotype of TAMs. In addition, MyD88 expression in myeloid 
cells drove melanoma progression. The MyD88/IL1 receptor (IL1R) axis regulated 
programmed cell death (PD)-1 expression on TAMs by promoting recruitment of 
NF-κBp65 to the Pdcd1 promoter. Furthermore, a combinatorial immunotherapy 
approach combining the MyD88 inhibitor with anti-PD-1 blockade elicited strong 
antitumor effects. Thus, the MyD88/IL1R axis maintains the immunosuppressive 
function of TAMs and promotes tumor growth by regulating PD-1 expression. 
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that MyD88 regulates TAM-immunosuppressive 
activity, suggesting that macrophage-mediated immunotherapy combining MYD88 
inhibitors with PD-1 blockade could result in better treatment outcomes in a 
wide variety of cancers. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT:

Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin reduces the incidence and 
mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, underlying mechanisms have not 
been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to examine the pathological 
characteristics of resected CRC from patients treated with metformin for type 2 
diabetes mellitus (DM). In total, 267 patients with DM underwent curative 
colectomy for Stage I-III CRC and 53 (19.9%) patients had been treated medically 
including metformin. Pathological N-stage was significantly lower in 
metformin-treated patients (P < .05) with prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) 
(P < .05). Immunohistochemistry showed that the densities of CD3(+) and CD8(+) 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the invasive front area were 
significantly higher in 40 patients treated with metformin compared with 
propensity score matched cases without metformin (P < .05). The density of 
tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in tumor stroma was markedly increased in 
metformin-treated patients (P < .001). In those tumors, there were more CD68(+) 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) infiltrated (P < .05), while the ratio of 
CD163(+) M2-phenotype was markedly reduced (P < .001). Stromal fibrosis tended 
to be suppressed by metformin intake (P = .051). These findings suggested that 
metformin drastically changes the characteristics of infiltrating immune cells 
in CRC and reprograms the tumor microenvironment from immunosuppressive to 
immunocompetent status, which may lead to suppression of microscopic tumor 
spread and improve the outcomes of patients with CRC and type 2 DM.

Dysregulation of immune system is the hallmark of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) 
patients. Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) is closely related to progression 
and immunotherapy of COAD. However, the intrinsic correlation of immune system 
with AS have not been elucidated. Here we identified 640 AS events related to 
immunescore by multi-omics data analysis. 7 key AS events were screened out and 
used to develop a riskscore model, the area under the ROC curve of riskscore 
model predicting 3-, 5-year survival probability was 0.750, 0.768. Also, the 
riskscore based on 7 key AS events is an independent prognostic factor. The AUC 
of the nomogram composed of riskscore and TMN grade reached to 0.872(3-year) and 
0.841(5-year). Moreover, 11 AS events were identified to be associated with the 
infiltration of 8 types of immune cells. Interestingly, M1 macrophages and 
memory B cells had a higher infiltration in high-riskscore patients, and higher 
infiltration of M1 macrophages and memory B cells were significantly associated 
with worse prognosis. In conclusion, AS are closely related to immunescore, 
immunity stage and infiltrating immune cells. The riskscore is an effective 
diagnostic and prognostic indicator better than TMN grade, and AS events related 
to the immune system may be potential therapeutic targets for COAD.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the prognostic significance of 
tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
patients.
METHODS: Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the 
infiltration of CD163+ TAMs in 209 CRC samples, and the Kaplan-Meier method was 
used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used for 
univariate analysis and multivariate analysis of clinically relevant 
confounders.
RESULTS: The samples were divided into low-level (n = 105) and high-level 
infiltration groups (n = 104) by the median number of CD163+ TAMs detected. The 
overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of CRC patients in the 
low-level CD163+ TAM infiltration group were longer than those in the high-level 
CD163+ TAM infiltration group (P < 0.001). Infiltration of CD163+ TAMs in CRC 
tissues was a negative prognostic factor for CRC patients. Risks of death and 
disease recurrence for CRC patients in the low-level CD163+ TAM infiltration 
group were lower than those in the high-level CD163+ TAM infiltration group 
(HROS = 0.183, 95% CI 0.052-0.647, P = 0.008; HRDFS = 0.191, 95% CI 0.078-0.470, 
P = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: The infiltration of CD163+ TAMs in CRC tissue is an independent 
adverse factor for the prognosis of CRC patients. High-level infiltration of 
CD163+ TAMs is associated with shorter OS and DFS.

Lymph node (LN) dissection followed by histological analysis is the current 
standard for diagnosis of LN metastasis but the method suffers from patient 
morbidity and low sensitivity of detection. Ultra-pH sensitive (UPS) 
nanoparticles show remarkable accuracy in the delineation of primary tumor 
margins for precision cancer surgery. Herein we investigate the effectiveness of 
UPS nanoparticles to detect cancer-involved LNs. Methods: We synthesized a 
series of indocyanine green (ICG) conjugated UPS nanoparticles with distinct pKa 
(UPS5.3, UPS6.1, and UPS6.9). Systemically administered UPS-ICG nanoparticles in 
the 4T1.2-BALB/cj mouse model were imaged with real-time, near-infrared 
fluorescence (NIRF) to guide removal of LNs. Ex vivo imaging of gross tissue 
enabled quantification of fluorescence intensity. Histological analysis was used 
as the gold standard diagnostic test. Results: Macrophage uptake of UPS 
nanoparticles elevates the background signal in benign LNs. However, cancer foci 
within LNs show distinctive clustering of UPS-ICG fluorescence. UPS5.3 achieves 
accurate detection of metastatic LNs as shown by a receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 ± 0.03. UPS6.1 and 
UPS6.9 offer decreased discriminatory power at ROC AUC of 0.73 ± 0.1 and 0.88 ± 
0.07, respectively. Conclusions: All UPS compositions show cancer-specific 
discrimination of metastatic LNs over benign LNs with the best outcomes from 
UPS5.3. Detection of micro-metastatic LNs (cancer foci < 2 mm) remains a 
challenge. This study provides information on the detection of LN status for 
image-guided resection of metastatic LNs.

Ferritin is the most important iron storage form and is known to influence tumor 
immunity. We previously showed that expression of ferritin light chain (FTL) and 
ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) subunits is increased in head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSC). Here, we analyzed solid tumor datasets from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases to investigate correlations 
between FTL and FTH1 expressions and (i) patient survival, using univariate, 
multivariate, Kaplan-Meier and Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis; and 
(ii) tumor-infiltrating immune cell subsets, using the bioinformatics tools 
Estimation of Stomal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues, 
Microenvironment Cell Population-counter, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, and 
Tumor Immunology Miner. We found that FTL and FTH1 are upregulated and 
downregulated, respectively, in most of the human cancers analyzed. Tumor FTL 
levels were associated with prognosis in patients with lower grade glioma (LGG), 
whereas FTH1 levels were associated with prognosis in patients with liver 
hepatocellular carcinoma, HNSC, LGG, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma. 
In many cancers, FTL and FTH1 levels was significantly positively correlated 
with tumor infiltration by tumor-associated macrophages and T regulatory cells. 
These results suggest an important role for FTL and FTH1 in regulating tumor 
immunity to solid cancers.

A predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based treatments in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, 
we focused on the infiltration and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment of HCC. 
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PD-L1 was preferentially expressed on 
CD68+ macrophages in the tumor microenvironment of HCC, suggestive of its 
expression in TAMs rather than in T cells or tumor cells (P < 0.05). A 
co-culture experiment using activated T cells and M2 macrophages confirmed a 
significant increase in T cell functionality after the pretreatment of M2 
macrophages with anti-PD-L1. Syngeneic mouse model experiments demonstrated that 
TAMs expressed PD-L1 and tumors treated with anti-PD-L1 showed smaller diameters 
than those treated with IgG. In these mice, anti-PD-L1 treatment increased 
activation markers in intratumoral CD8+ T cells and reduced the size of the TAM 
population. Regarding nivolumab-treated patients, three of eight patients 
responded to the anti-PD-1 treatment. The percentage of Ki-67-positive CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells was higher in responders than non-responders after nivolumab. 
Overall, PD-L1 expression on TAMs may be targeted by immune-based HCC treatment, 
and ICI treatment results in the reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells in 
HCC.

Background: The molecular mechanisms underlying gastric cancer (GC) progression 
are unclear. The authors examined key genes associated with the prognosis and 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells in patients with GC. Materials and Methods: Gene 
expression omnibus (GEO) was used to filter and obtain GC-related differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs). The molecular functions, biological processes, and 
cellular components of the DEGs were subjected to enrichment analysis. 
Protein-protein interaction networks of proteins encoded by the DEGs were 
analyzed using STRING. The authors also identified hub genes of GC, as well as 
their expression levels in GC and their relationship with patient prognosis. The 
relationship between hub genes and tumor-infiltrating immune cells was analyzed 
by Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource. Results: Six GEO datasets were included in 
this study, and 265 DEGs were identified. These DEGs were enriched in different 
signaling pathways and had different biological functions. Six hub genes were 
potentially significantly related to the molecular mechanisms of GC (TOP2A, FN1, 
SPARC, COL3A1, COL1A1, and TIMP1). These genes are potential markers of 
prognosis. Five hub genes were significantly positively correlated with the 
number of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Conclusions: The 
authors provide a theoretical basis for exploring the molecular regulation 
mechanism underlying GC and identifying therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggested that premetastatic niche (PMN) is a 
prerequisite in mediating cancer metastasis. Previously we demonstrated that 
XIAOPI formula could inhibit breast cancer lung metastasis via inhibiting tumor 
associated macrophages (TAMs)-secreted CXCL1. Herein, we aimed to explore the 
effects of XIAOPI formula on preventing breast cancer PMN formation and its 
underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: CXCL1 expression of TAMs was detected by qPCR and Western blotting 
assay. The influences of XIAOPI formula on the proliferation of TAMs and 4 T1 in 
the co-culture system were tested by CCK8 or EdU staining. Transwell experiment 
was applied to determine the effects of XIAOPI formula on the invasion ability 
of HSPCs and 4 T1. Breast cancer xenografts were built by inoculating 4 T1 cells 
into the mammary pads of Balb/c mice and lung metastasis was monitored by 
luciferase imaging. Immune fluorescence assay was used to test the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and PMN formation in the lung tissues. 
The effects of XIAOPI formula on TAMs phenotype, hematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells (HSPCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were determined by 
flow cytometry.
RESULTS: It was found that XIAOPI formula could inhibit the proliferation and 
polarization of M2 phenotype macrophages, and reduce CXCL1 expression in a 
dose-dependent manner. However, M1 phenotype macrophages were not significantly 
affected by XIAOPI formula. TAMs/CXCL1 signaling was subsequently found to 
stimulate the recruitment of c-Kit+/Sca-1+ HSPCs and their differentiation into 
CD11b+/Gr-1+ MDSCs, which were symbolic events accounting for PMN formation. 
Moreover, XIAOPI formula was effective in inhibiting HSPCs activation and 
suppressing the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells 4 T1 induced 
by HSPCs and TAMs co-culture system, implying that XIAOPI was effective in 
preventing PMN formation in vitro. Breast cancer xenograft experiments further 
demonstrated that XIAOPI formula could inhibit breast cancer PMN formation and 
subsequent lung metastasis in vivo. The populations of HSPCs in the bone marrow 
and MDSCs in the lung tissues were all remarkably declined by XIAOPI formula 
treatment. However, the inhibitory effects of XIAOPI formula could be relieved 
by CXCL1 overexpression in the TAMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study provided preclinical evidence supporting 
the application of XIAOPI formula in preventing breast cancer PMN formation, and 
highlighted TAMs/CXCL1 as a potential therapeutic strategy for PMN targeting 
therapy. Video Abstract.

Macrophages are an essential component of antitumor activity; however, the role 
of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains 
controversial. Here, we elucidated the role of TAMs in CRC progression, 
especially at the early stage. We assessed the TAM number, phenotype, and 
distribution in 53 patients with colorectal neoplasia, including intramucosal 
neoplasia, submucosal invasive colorectal cancer (SM-CRC), and advanced cancer, 
using double immunofluorescence for CD68 and CD163. Next, we focused on the 
invasive front in SM-CRC and association between TAMs and clinicopathological 
features including lymph node metastasis, which were evaluated in 87 SM-CRC 
clinical specimens. The number of M2 macrophages increased with tumor 
progression and dynamic changes were observed with respect to the number and 
phenotype of TAMs at the invasive front, especially at the stage of submucosal 
invasion. A high M2 macrophage count at the invasive front was correlated with 
lymphovascular invasion, low histological differentiation, and lymph node 
metastasis; a low M1 macrophage count at the invasive front was correlated with 
lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve 
analysis revealed that the M2/M1 ratio was a better predictor of the risk of 
lymph node metastasis than the pan-, M1, or M2 macrophage counts at the invasive 
front. These results suggested that TAMs at the invasive front might play a role 
in CRC progression, especially at the early stages. Therefore, evaluating the 
TAM phenotype, number, and distribution may be a potential predictor of 
metastasis, including lymph node metastasis, and TAMs may be a potential CRC 
therapeutic target.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed tumors among human 
worldwide. Angiogenesis and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment are 
closely associated with CRC development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms revealing 
CRC progression are still not fully understood. 5'-Nucleotidase domain 
containing 2 (NT5DC2), a member of the NT5DC family, modulates various cellular 
events to mediate tumor growth, and thus serves as a disgnostic biomarker. Here, 
we explored the potential of NT5DC2 on tumor progression in CRC. We first found 
that NT5DC2 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC tissues and cell 
lines. CRC patients with higher NT5DC2 expression showed poor overall survival. 
Furthermore, CRC cell lines stably transfected with shNT5DC2 lentivirus plasmids 
exhibited markedly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared 
with the negative control group. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression levels were remarkably 
reduced in CRC cells with NT5DC2 deletion, along with evidently reduced tube 
formation in the HUVECs cultured in the collected conditional medium. The 
expression levels of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 were 
found to be greatly down-regulated in CRC cells transfected with shNT5DC2. 
Moreover, NT5DC2 knockdown markedly suppressed the activation of protein 
kinase-B/nuclear transcription factor κB (AKT/NF-κB) signaling in CRC cells. 
Furthermore, we found that NT5DC2 deletion obviously reduced the TAM 
recruitments through suppressing CCL2/CCR2 and AKT/NF-κB signaling pathways. 
Intriguingly, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that VEGF reduction was 
necessary for shNT5DC2-inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, 
angiogenesis and TAM recruitment. In vivo studies also confirmed that NT5DC2 
knockdown effectively reduced the tumor growth and VEGF expression in a 
xonegraft mouse model with CRC. Lung metastasis of CRC cells was also hindered 
by NT5DC2 deletion in vivo. Collectively, our results indicated a previously 
unrecognized NT5DC2/VEGF/CCL2 axis involved in CRC development and metastasis.

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a major barrier 
for effective immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly 
heterogeneous and plastic cell components of the TME which can either promote 
tumor progression (M2-like) or boost antitumor immunity (M1-like). Here, we 
demonstrate that a subset of TAMs that express folate receptor β (FRβ) possess 
an immunosuppressive M2-like profile. In syngeneic tumor mouse models, chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-mediated selective elimination of FRβ+ TAMs in the 
TME results in an enrichment of pro-inflammatory monocytes, an influx of 
endogenous tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, delayed tumor progression, and prolonged 
survival. Preconditioning of the TME with FRβ-specific CAR-T cells also improves 
the effectiveness of tumor-directed anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells, while 
simultaneous co-administration of both CAR products does not. These results 
highlight the pro-tumor role of FRβ+ TAMs in the TME and the therapeutic 
implications of TAM-depleting agents as preparative adjuncts to conventional 
immunotherapies that directly target tumor antigens.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Splenectomy has been reported to attenuate liver fibrosis. 
In addition, phenotype transitions of infiltrating macrophages, including 
Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow, play an essential role in the liver fibrosis. However, 
whether the spleen can regulate the phenotype switch of macrophages and the 
underlying mechanism still remain unclear.
METHODS: Chronic liver fibrosis in mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection 
with carbon tetrachloride. Splenectomy or sham operation was performed with or 
without depletion of macrophages during liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis and the 
proportion of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow macrophages were analyzed. Western blotting 
of ERK1/2 signals was performed in isolated macrophages to investigate the 
underlying mechanism of phenotype transition. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by 
liver total cells conditioned medium with or without preincubation of SCH772984, 
the ERK1/2 inhibitor, and the phenotype switch of RAW264.7 cells was examined. 
In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of SCH772984 was performed on the splenectomy 
mice and the phenotype switch of liver infiltrating macrophages was tested.
RESULTS: Splenectomy alleviated the liver inflammation and fibrosis and also 
promoted the phenotypic switch of infiltrating macrophages to a Ly6Clow 
phenotype in fibrotic liver. The p-ERK1/2 expression was upregulated in 
macrophages at the same time. Furthermore, splenectomy increased the percentage 
of Ly6Clow macrophages and decreased the percentage of Ly6Chigh macrophages both 
in vivo and in vitro, which was reversed by SCH772984.
CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomy attenuates both the liver fibrosis and inflammation, 
and promotes the phenotype switch of infiltrating macrophages to an 
anti-inflammatory Ly6Clow phenotype by activating the ERK1/2 pathway during 
liver fibrosis.

BACKGROUNDS: Triptolide (TP) exhibits effective activity against colon cancer in 
multiple preclinical models, but the mechanisms underlying the observed effects 
are not fully understood. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent bioactive 
sphingolipid involved in the regulation of colon cancer progression. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the effect of TP on the sphingosine kinase 
(SPHK)-S1P signaling pathway in colitis-associated colon cancer.
METHODS: An azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model and the 
THP-1 cell line were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of 
TP in colitis-associated colon cancer (CACC). Various molecular cell biology 
experiments, including Western blotting, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence, 
were used to obtain relevant experimental data. A liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was also established to detect the levels of 
S1P in tissue and plasma.
RESULTS: In the AOM/DSS mouse model, TP treatment induced a dose-dependent 
decrease in tumor incidence and inhibited macrophage recruitment and M2 
polarization in the tumors. TP also efficiently decreased the S1P levels and 
SPHK1/S1PR1/S1PR2 expression and significantly inhibited activation of the 
S1P-mediated phosphorylation of ERK protein in macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that TP might influence the recruitment and 
polarization of tumor-associated macrophages by suppressing the SPHK-S1P 
signaling pathway.

Increasing evidence indicates that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment can 
lead to cancer cell metastasis. Shikonin, which is extracted from the Chinese 
herb Zicao (the dried root of Lithospermum erythrorhizon), possesses various 
pharmacological effects, but its effect on tumor metastasis in the inflammatory 
microenvironment remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate 
the potential effect of shikonin on tumor metastasis in an inflammatory 
microenvironment as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. It was found 
that, in the inflammatory microenvironment simulated by THP‑1 cell conditioned 
medium (THP‑1‑CM) in vitro, shikonin significantly inhibited the 
epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion of human lung 
adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and H1299. In addition, we found that 
interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), which is expressed in THP‑1‑CM, promoted the EMT of lung 
adenocarcinoma cells, and shikonin markedly inhibited IL‑6‑induced EMT and cell 
motility. Moreover, shikonin inhibited IL‑6‑induced phosphorylation of signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), prevented phosphorylated 
STAT3 (p‑STAT3) translocation into the nucleus, and suppressed p‑STAT3 
transactivation activity. Additionally, it was found that shikonin inhibited 
lung metastasis, EMT and expression of p‑STAT3 of A549 cells in vivo. 
Furthermore, IL‑6 levels in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues were significantly 
associated with tumor‑node‑metastasis stage and lymph node metastasis, and its 
expression was correlated with tumor‑associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration. 
Together, these results suggest that shikonin suppresses the migration and 
invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma cells in an inflammatory microenvironment 
involving the IL‑6/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Chemotherapy resistance eventually develops in patients with gastric cancer 
(GC). Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) refers to the intercellular genetic 
variations and phenotypic diversity that affect responses to drug therapy. We 
measured ITH using mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) derived from 
whole-exome sequencing data of patients with GC in The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database. The study included 385 patients from the TCGA database with 
available data regarding gastrectomy, survival, and whole-exome sequencing. 
Further analysis was performed in 171 GC patients with available data regarding 
adjuvant chemotherapy. Multiple factor analysis showed that MATH was an 
independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.432; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.073-1.913; P = 0.015) in patients with GC. Moreover, MATH was also an 
independent predictor of OS among the 171 GC patients who received adjuvant 
chemotherapy (HR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.236-3.289; P = 0.005). Pathway enrichment and 
immune cell analyses revealed significantly higher infiltration by 20 types of 
immune cells in the low/intermediate group, compared to the group with high MATH 
scores. In conclusion, low/intermediate MATH scores predicted longer OS, when 
compared to those with high MATH scores. The immune response was obviously 
upregulated in patients with GC and low/intermediate MATH scores.

Tumour-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization is associated with 
hepatocellular carcinoma but the molecular mechanism of this polarization is 
still unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were induced to differentiate 
into M0, M1 and M2 macrophages and TAMs. TAMs were transfected with 
pcDNA3.1-GAS5, pcDNA3.1-NC, si-GAS5, si-PTEN or si-Ctrl. A human liver cancer 
cell line (SMCC-7721) was incubated with the modified TAM supernatant. 
Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to detect gene and 
protein expression. The cell proliferation and invasion properties of the 
SMCC-7721 cells were detected by MTT and Transwell assays. GAS5 is up-regulated 
in M1 macrophages and down-regulated in M2 macrophages and TAMs. GAS5 
overexpression promoted M1-like polarization of TAMs and inhibited M2-like 
polarization of TAMs. Moreover, GAS5 promoted the expression of PTEN in TAMs. 
PTEN-silenced TAM supernatant treatment promoted cell proliferative and invasive 
properties of the SMCC-7721 cells and diminished the effect of 
GAS5-overexpressed TAM supernatant on the cell proliferation and invasion by 
SMCC-7721 cells. Our results demostrared that GAS5 overexpression inhibited 
M2-like polarization of TAMs by enhancing PTEN expression, thereby inhibiting 
cell proliferation and invasion by SMCC-7721 cells. Thus, our results suggest 
that GAS5 may be a new therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

Background: Lactate greatly contributes to the regulation of intracellular 
communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the role of 
lactate in pituitary adenoma (PA) invasion is unclear. In this study, we aimed 
to clarify the effects of lactate on the TME and the effects of TME on PA 
invasion. Methods: To explore the correlation between TME acidosis and tumor 
invasion, LDHA and LAMP2 expression levels were quantified in invasive (n = 32) 
and noninvasive (n = 32) PA samples. The correlation between immune cell 
infiltration and tumor invasion was evaluated in 64 PAs. Critical chemokine and 
key signaling pathway components were detected by qPCR, Western blotting, siRNA 
knockdown, and specific inhibitors. The functional consequences of CCR4 
signaling inhibition were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: Lactate was 
positively associated with PA invasion. Of the 64 PA tissues, invasive PAs were 
related to high infiltration of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (P < 
0.05). Moreover, lactate secreted from PA cells facilitated M2 polarization via 
the mTORC2 and ERK signaling pathways, while activated TAMs secreted CCL17 to 
promote PA invasion via the CCL17/CCR4/mTORC1 axis. According to univariate 
analysis of clinical data, high CCL17 expression was associated with larger 
tumor size (P = 0.0438), greater invasion (P = 0.0334), and higher 
susceptibility to postoperative recurrence (P = 0.0195) in human PAs. 
Conclusion: This study illustrates the dynamics between PA cells and immune TME 
in promoting PA invasion via M2 polarization. CCL17 levels in the TME are 
related to the PA invasiveness and clinical prognosis, and the CCL17/CCR4/mTOCR1 
axis may serve as potential therapeutic targets for Pas.

The antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used chemotherapy regimen 
for the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). However, resistance to 5-FU remains a 
major drawback in the clinical use. The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents 
recruit tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the 
chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. 
Here, we demonstrate that YAP1 is overexpressed in resistant GC tissues compared 
to sensitive GC tissues. Further, IL-3 secreted by YAP1-overexpressed GC could 
skew macrophage polarization to M2-like phenotype and inducing GLUT3-depended 
glycolysis program. Meanwhile, polarized M2 macrophages enhance 5-FU resistance 
in tumor cells by secreting CCL8 and activating phosphorylation of JAK1/STAT3 
signaling pathway.

Lung cancers remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and 
women. Infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a 
critical role in the formation, progression, and the response of solid tumors to 
therapy, including in lung cancers. Clinical studies have established that 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their phenotypical composition are 
critical immune infiltrates in the lung TME, with the abundance of the M2-like 
phenotype negatively correlating with patient survival. Colony-Stimulating 
Factor 1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R) is a type III protein tyrosine kinase 
receptor that plays an important role in the recruitment and differentiation of 
monocytes into tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs and their survival. In this work we 
evaluated the therapeutic potential of PLX 3397 (PLX), a small molecule CSF-1R 
inhibitor (CSF-1Ri), upon local lung administration in an immune-competent mouse 
model of lung cancer. The efficacy of local lung delivered PLX as single therapy 
was investigated first. As assessed by immunofluorescence of sections of lung 
tumor nodules, a statistically significant reduction in M2-like TAMs and an 
increase in M1-like TAMs was observed, thus leading to a shift in the (M1/M2) 
balance. Those changes in abundance of immune infiltrates correlated with a 
significant decrease in tumor burden when compared to control. When combined 
with systemically administered cisplatin (CIS) PLX treatment provided further 
benefits, leading to a significant decrease in tumor burden when compared to 
either PLX or CIS treatments alone, as measured by bioluminescence intensity 
(BLI) in vivo (thoracic area) and ex vivo (lung tissue). This combination 
therapy led to the most pronounced increase in M1/M2 ratio, followed by a 
significant decrease in M2-like TAMs with the CIS therapy. This work is 
clinically relevant as it demonstrates the potential of local lung 
administration of PLX to support standard of care chemotherapy for lung cancer 
management. This is important as the pulmonary route of administration is a 
plausible strategy for reducing the total dose of CSF-1Ris as the tissue of 
interest (lungs) can be locally targeted. Because the major off-target effect of 
CSF-1Ris is liver toxicity, reducing systemic concentration will support 
translation of those therapies, especially in combination with standard of care 
chemotherapy that has significant off-target toxicity and patient attrition 
itself. This work is scientifically relevant as we demonstrate for the first 
time that local administration of a CSF-1Ri to the lungs leads to a shift in the 
balance of TAMs in the TME of a model of lung tumor, adding to the sparse 
literature of CSF-1Ris related to lung cancers.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) constitute up to 50-80% of stromal cells in 
breast cancer (BC), and are correlated with poor prognosis. As epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in 60-80% of patients with triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC), photoimmunotherapy (PIT) with cetuximab-targeted 
gold nanorods (CTX-AuNR) is an attractive therapeutic strategy for TNBC. The 3D 
cell culture model can mimic drug resistance conferred by the tumor 
microenvironment and its 3D organization; therefore, TAM and non-TAM embedded 
TNBC spheroids were constructed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CTX-AuNR 
plus near infrared (NIR) irradiation. Cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation, and protein expression were compared in TNBC (± TAM) 
spheroids. The IC50 values of doxorubicin (DOX) in TAM-embedded TNBC spheroids 
were significantly higher than those in TNBC spheroids, demonstrating drug 
resistance, which could be explained by activation of IL-10/IL-10 
receptor/STAT3/Bcl-2 signaling. However, 3D in vitro and in vivo results 
demonstrated that the efficacy of CTX-AuNR plus NIR irradiation was not 
significantly different in (± TAM) embedded TNBC cells. By enhancing ROS 
generation, CTX-AuNR plus NIR irradiation reprogrammed TAM polarization to the 
M1 anti-tumor phenotype, as indicated by macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) 
downregulation. Thus, CTX-AuNR plus NIR can serve as a potent PIT strategy for 
treating EGFR-overexpressing TNBC cells.

BACKGROUND: Overexpression of sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) is a marker of 
poor prognosis in numerous tumors and is recognized as an index of tumor 
proliferation; however, its expression in liver cancer remains unclear.
METHODS: The Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org) and Timer 
(https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer) databases were used to analyze the 
expression of SPAG5 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal liver 
tissues. The relationship between the expression of SPAG5 and immune 
infiltration of HCC was investigated using the Timer and GEPIA 
(http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn) databases, and the mechanism was analyzed using 
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
(http://kmplot.com/analysis) was used to evaluate the effect of SPAG5 on the 
prognosis of patients with HCC.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the SPAG5 expression level was positively 
correlated with the infiltration levels of CD8+ T cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils, and especially B cells and dendritic cells. In addition, SPAG5 
expression was significantly associated with T cell exhaustion. The overall 
survival time, progression-free survival time, recurrence-free survival time and 
disease-specific survival time were significantly reduced for HCC patients with 
high SPAG5 expression (p < 0.01) and high expression of SPAG5 was significantly 
associated with a poor overall survival time and progression-free survival time 
of grade and stage II-III HCC (p < 0.05) but not with stage I HCC (p > 0.05). 
Additionally, the expression of SPAG5 is related to the p53 and cell cycle 
signal pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, SPAG5 is not only a marker of immune infiltration 
and poor prognosis, but also a potential therapeutic target for liver cancer.

BACKGROUND: The clinical management of pancreatic and other periampullary 
neoplasms remains challenging. In contrast to other cancer types, 
immunotherapies are largely ineffective, and the reason for the deprived immune 
response and the immune inhibiting cellular composition is only fragmentarily 
understood. The aim of this study was to comprehensively map the abundance, 
topographic distribution and spatial interaction of innate and innate-like 
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of periampullary adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging was performed on tissue 
microarrays with tumors from a consecutive cohort of 175 patients with resected 
periampullary adenocarcinoma. To obtain a detailed spatial analysis of immune 
cell infiltration, two multiplex immune panels including antibodies against CD3, 
NKp46, CD56, CD68, CD163 and CD1a, CD208, CD123, CD15, CD68 and pan-cytokeratin 
were applied.
RESULTS: The infiltration of natural killer (NK) and NK-like T (NKT) cells was 
lower in malignant compared to benign tissue. NKT cells were more abundant in 
intestinal type compared to pancreatobiliary type tumors, and were associated 
with more favorable clinicopathological features and a prolonged survival. The 
interaction of NKp46+ NKT cells with macrophages was also associated with a 
prolonged survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive map of the innate immune 
landscape in periampullary adenocarcinoma. NK cells, and even more so NKT cells, 
are revealed to be central players in the local immune response in a clinically 
relevant context.

BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)s are critical regulators of 
glioma progression. As yet, however, TAMs in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
mutated lower-grade gliomas (LGGs) have not been thoroughly investigated. The 
aim of this study was to determine whether 1p/19q co-deletion status affects the 
TAM phenotype or its prevalence in IDH mutated LGGs.
METHODS: TAMs in IDH mutated LGGs were analyzed using transcriptome data from 
230 samples in the TCGA database in combination with transcriptome data from 
single-cell RNA sequencing of IDH-mutated LGGs. Proteins potentially involved in 
TAM regulation were examined by immuno-staining in primary LGG samples harboring 
IDH mutations. Essential signaling pathways regulating TAM phenotypes were 
investigated in a glioma mouse model using small molecule inhibitors.
RESULTS: Most of the TAMs in IDH-mutated LGGs expressed the M1 activation 
markers CD86 and TNF, whereas a subset of individual TAMs co-expressed both M1 
and M2-related markers. Bioinformatics analysis in combination with 
immuno-staining of IDH-mutated patient samples revealed higher amounts of TAMs 
expressing M2-related markers in 1p/19q non-codeletion IDH-mutated LGGs compared 
to 1p/19q codeletion LGGs. The levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 
(TGFβ1) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were significantly 
higher in 1p/19q non-codeletion LGGs than in 1p/19q codeletion LGGs. M-CSF and 
TGFβ1 signal inhibition decreased tumor growth and modulated the TAM phenotype 
in a glioma mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 1p/19q co-deletion status relates to 
distinct TAM infiltration in gliomas, which is likely mediated by M-CSF and 
TGFβ1 signaling. M-CSF and TGFβ1 signaling may play a pivotal role in regulating 
the TAM phenotype in glioma.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with a high 
recurrence rate and poor outcomes in clinic. In this study, inspired by the 
enriched innate immune cell type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in TNBC, we 
proposed a matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) responsive integrated 
immunochemotherapeutic strategy to deliver paclitaxel (PTX) and anti-CD47 
(aCD47) by detachable immune liposomes (ILips). In the TNBC microenvironment, 
the "two-in-one" ILips facilitated MMP2-responsive release of aCD47 to 
efficiently polarize M2 macrophages toward the M1 phenotype to enhance 
phagocytosis against tumor cells and activate the systemic T cell immune 
response. Together with the immune effect, the detached PTX-loaded liposomes 
were internalized in MDA-MB-231 cells to synergistically inhibit tumor cell 
proliferation and metastasis. In the TNBC-bearing mouse model, PTX-loaded ILips 
demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy against TNBC and inhibited tumor 
recurrence. Our integrated strategy represents a promising approach to 
synchronously enhance immune response and tumor-killing effects, improving the 
therapeutic efficacy against TNBC.

Chronic inflammation increases the risk for colorectal cancer through a variety 
of mechanisms involving the tumor microenvironment. MAPK-activated protein 
kinase 2 (MK2), a major effector of the p38 MAPK stress and DNA damage response 
signaling pathway, and a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production, has been identified as a key contributor to colon tumorigenesis 
under conditions of chronic inflammation. We have previously described how 
genetic inactivation of MK2 in an inflammatory model of colon cancer results in 
delayed tumor progression, decreased tumor angiogenesis, and impaired macrophage 
differentiation into a pro-tumorigenic M2-like state. The molecular mechanism 
responsible for the impaired angiogenesis and tumor progression, however, has 
remained contentious and poorly defined. Here, using RNA expression analysis, 
assays of angiogenesis factors, genetic models, in vivo macrophage depletion and 
reconstitution of macrophage MK2 function using adoptive cell transfer, we 
demonstrate that MK2 activity in macrophages is necessary and sufficient for 
tumor angiogenesis during inflammation-induced cancer progression. We identify a 
critical and previously unappreciated role for MK2-dependent regulation of the 
well-known pro-angiogenesis factor CXCL-12/SDF-1 secreted by tumor 
associated-macrophages, in addition to MK2-dependent regulation of 
Serpin-E1/PAI-1 by several cell types within the tumor microenvironment.

BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are closely related to the occurrence 
of cancer, but its mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) is still largely unclear.
AIMS: This study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanism of LncRNA ANCR in GC.
METHODS: The expression of LncRNA ANCR was detected by qRT-PCR. ELISA was used 
to identify THP-1 cells into macrophage M1 type polarization. After macrophages 
overexpressing LncRNA ANCR were co-cultured with GC cell HGC-27, the invasion 
and metastasis of GC were analyzed by Transwell assay. The targeted regulation 
of FoxO1 by LncRNA ANCR was analyzed by RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation 
(RIP), and Western blot. The BALB/c nude mouse model of GC was established to 
analyze the effect of LncRNA ANCR on tumor growth.
RESULTS: LncRNA ANCR was highly expressed in GC. The overexpression of LncRNA 
ANCR in macrophages reduced the concentrations of M1 macrophage polarized marker 
molecules IL-1β and IL-6 in the supernatant of cells, and inhibited the 
polarization of macrophages to M1, while the knockdown of LncRNA ANCR produced 
the opposite effect. The co-culture of macrophages overexpressing LncRNA ANCR 
with GC cells promoted the invasion and migration of cells. LncRNA ANCR targeted 
FoxO1 and inhibited the expression of FoxO1 in THP-1 cells by promoting FoxO1 
ubiquitination degradation. In addition, the overexpression of LncRNA ANCR 
promoted tumor growth in a BALB/c nude mouse model of GC, while the knockdown of 
LncRNA ANCR produced the opposite effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the overexpression of LncRNA ANCR promoted 
the invasion and metastasis of GC cells via down-regulating FoxO1 to inhibit 
macrophage polarization to M1.

Tumor associated macrophage responses are regulated by distinct metabolic states 
that affect their function. However, the ability of specific signals in the 
local tumor microenvironment to program macrophage metabolism remains under 
investigation. Here, we identify NAMPT, the rate limiting enzyme in NAD salvage 
synthesis, as a target of STAT1 during cellular activation by interferon gamma, 
an important driver of macrophage polarization and antitumor responses. We 
demonstrate that STAT1 occupies a conserved element within the first intron of 
Nampt, termed Nampt-Regulatory Element-1 (NRE1). Through disruption of NRE1 or 
pharmacological inhibition, a subset of M1 genes is sensitive to NAMPT activity 
through its impact on glycolytic processes. scRNAseq is used to profile in vivo 
responses by NRE1-deficient, tumor-associated leukocytes in melanoma tumors 
through the creation of a unique mouse strain. Reduced Nampt and inflammatory 
gene expression are present in specific myeloid and APC populations; moreover, 
targeted ablation of NRE1 in macrophage lineages results in greater tumor 
burden. Finally, elevated NAMPT expression correlates with IFNγ responses and 
melanoma patient survival. This study identifies IFN and STAT1-inducible Nampt 
as an important factor that shapes the metabolic program and function of tumor 
associated macrophages.

Few studies have investigated the potential of tumor immune microenvironment 
genes as indicators of urinary bladder cancer. Here, we sought to establish an 
immune-related gene signature for determining prognosis and treatment options. 
We developed a ten-gene tumor immune microenvironment signature and evaluated 
its prognostic capacity on internal and external cohorts. Multivariate Cox 
regression and nomogram analyses revealed the prognostic risk model as an 
independent and effective indicator of prognosis. We observed lower proportions 
of CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, higher proportions of 
macrophages and neutrophils in high UBC risk group. UBC tissues with high-risk 
score tend to exhibit high TP53 and RB1 mutation rates, high PD1/PD-L1 
expression and poor-survival basal squamous subtypes, while those with low-risk 
score tend to have high FGFR3 mutation rates and luminal papillary subtypes. 
Unexpectedly, we found a highly significant positive correlation between 
glycolytic genes and risk score, highlighting metabolic competition in tumor 
ecosystem and potential therapeutic avenues. Our study thus revealed a tumor 
immune microenvironment signature for predicting prognostic and response to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors against bladder cancer. Prospective studies are 
required to further test the predictive capacity of this model.

Macrophages are the most abundant tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Macrophages 
are conventionally classified as M1 or M2 types. M2 type is the dominant 
phenotype of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. M2 macrophages support 
different aspects of tumor development, including tumor formation, growth, and 
metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to regulate numerous 
cellular processes, including macrophage polarization. To determine whether 
miR-33 containing exosomes can alter macrophage polarization, we used the 
exosomes isolated from 4T1 breast cancer cells to deliver miR-33 mimic into IL-4 
induced M2 macrophages and treated macrophages with 4T1-conditioned media. Then, 
we assayed the expression of M1 specific markers and the production of cytokines 
using real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Additionally, we performed MTT, 
migration, and invasion assays to detect the effect of miRNA-mediated macrophage 
repolarization on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The 
results of this study showed that miR-33 containing exosomes could convert M2 to 
M1 phenotype as indicated by an increase in expression of M1 markers, including 
Irf5, Nos2, and CD86, and a decrease in M2 markers including Arg, Ym1, and 
CD206. Furthermore, the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β as M1 specific cytokines 
increased, while the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β as M2 specific cytokines 
decreased. Incubation of 4T1 cells with conditioned media of treated macrophages 
showed reduced proliferation, invasion, and migration of these cells. So, our 
data suggests that exosomes can be used as an efficient nanocarrier for miR-33 
delivery into macrophages. Also, miR-33 is capable of inducing M1 polarization 
in macrophages, which is essential for suppressing tumor growth and metastasis.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with its aggressive biological behavior, is 
one of the most diagnosed cancers. Tumor-associated inflammatory cells play 
important roles in the interaction between chronic inflammation and lung cancer, 
however the mechanisms involved are far from defined. In the present study, by 
developing an orthotopic NSCLC mouse model based on chronic inflammation, we 
proved that an inflammatory microenvironment accelerated the growth of 
orthotopic xenografts in vivo. Tumor-associated macrophages, the most abundant 
population of inflammatory cells, were identified. Treatment with 
macrophage-conditioned medium (MCM) promoted the growth and migration of NSCLC 
cells. Using bioinformatics analysis, we identified downregulated PP2Ac 
expression in NSCLC cells upon treatment with MCM. We further confirmed that 
this downregulation was executed in an NF-κB pathway-dependent manner. As IκB 
kinase (IKK) has been proved to be a substrate of PP2Ac, inhibition on PP2Ac 
could result in amplification of NF-κB pathway signaling. Overexpression of 
PP2Ac, or the dominant-negative forms of IKK or IκB, attenuated the acceleration 
of growth and metastasis by MCM. Using bioinformatics analysis, we further 
identified that CXCL1 and COL6A1 could be downstream of NF-κB/PP2Ac pathway. 
Luciferase assay and ChIP assay further confirmed the location of response 
elements on the promoter regions of CXCL1 and COL6A1. Elevated CXCL1 facilitated 
angiogenesis, whereas upregulated COL6A1 promoted proliferation and migration.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a more aggressive phenotype and higher 
metastasis and recurrence rates than other breast cancer subtypes. The immune 
microenvironment and hypoxic microenvironment of breast cancer constitute the 
survival environment of cancer cells, which is an important environment to 
support cancer cells. LXA4 and its analog, BML-111 is an important regulator of 
inflammatory cytokines, which provides a possible way for the treatment of 
inflammatory-related tumors. Here, in the in vitro experiment, we showed that 
BML-111 could inhibit the EMT and migration of TAMs-stimulated TNBC by 
down-regulating ILK as well as p-Akt and p-GSK3β. And it could prevent the 
formation of breast cancer cell clusters. In the in vivo experiment, BML-111 
could inhibit the metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells. We also demonstrated 
that BML-111 could affect macrophages in tumor microenvironment to prevent 
metastasis. These results showed that BML-111 could be a possible candidate for 
breast cancer therapy by targeting ILK and TAMs.

It is necessary to create novel, efficacious and harmless therapeutic strategy 
for lung cancer treatment. The application of nanoemulsion to specifically 
suppress cancer progression in the tumor microenvironment would be an effective 
therapy. Neobavaisoflavone (Neo) is an isoflavone isolated from Psoralea 
corylifolia L, possesses striking anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. In 
our stduy, Neo significantly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in 
the activated myofibroblast. Furthermore, a novel Neo nanoemulsion (nano-Neo) 
was prepared to improve Neo solubility and bioavailability. Nano-Neo showed more 
effectively anti-proliferative role in lung cancer cells. In addition, in vivo 
analysis further demonstrated that nano-Neo could effectively suppress tumor 
growth compared to the free Neo-treated mice without noticeable damage to major 
organs. Furthermore, nano-Neo treatment markedly reduced extracellular matrix 
(ECM) deposition in tumor samples by repressing transforming growth factor-β 
(TGF-β)/SMADs signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the activated immune 
microenvironment in tumor tissues was dramatically improved by nano-Neo through 
reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
infiltration, as well as improving the count of natural killer (NK) cells and M2 
macrophage phenotype switch to pro-inflammatory M1. In addition, we found that 
the prepared nano-Neo exerted promising tumor targeting efficiency with improved 
pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the novel approach to prepare nano-Neo 
introduced here might provide an effective strategy for lung cancer treatment 
with few adverse effects.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in solid tumors where they 
exhibit immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic functions. Inhibition of TAM 
proliferation and survival through CSF1R blockade has been widely explored as a 
cancer immunotherapy. To further define mechanisms regulating CSF1R-targeted 
therapies, we systematically evaluated the effect of anti-CSF1R treatment on 
tumor growth and tumor microenvironment (TME) inflammation across multiple 
murine models. Despite substantial macrophage depletion, anti-CSF1R had minimal 
effects on the anti-tumor immune response in mice bearing established tumors. In 
contrast, anti-CSF1R treatment concurrent with tumor implantation resulted in 
more robust tumor growth inhibition and evidence of enhanced anti-tumor 
immunity. Our findings suggest only minor contributions of CSF1R-dependent TAMs 
to the inflammatory state of the TME in established tumors, that immune 
landscape heterogeneity across different tumor models can influence anti-CSF1R 
activity, and that alternative treatment schedules and/or TAM depletion 
strategies may be needed to maximize the clinical benefit of this approach.

Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) are forced by cancer cells to adopt an 
anti-inflammatory phenotype and secrete factors to promote tumour invasion thus 
being responsible for poor patient outcome. The aim of this study is to develop 
a clinically applicable, non-invasive method to obtain a quantitative TAM 
detection in tumour tissue. The method is based on longitudinal proton 
relaxation rate (R1) measurements at low field (0.01-1 MHz) to assess the 
localization of ferumoxytol (clinical approved iron oxide particles) in TAM 
present in melanoma tumours, where R1 = 1/T1. R1 at low magnetic fields appears 
highly dependent on the intra or extra cellular localization of the 
nanoparticles thus allowing an unambiguous TAM quantification. R1 profiles were 
acquired on a Fast Field-Cycling relaxometer equipped with a 40 mm wide bore 
magnet and an 11 mm solenoid detection coil placed around the anatomical region 
of interest. The R1 values measured 3 h and 24 h after the injection were 
significantly different. At 24 h R1 exhibited a behavior similar to "in vitro" 
ferumoxytol-labelled J774A.1 macrophages whereas at 3 h, when the ferumoxytol 
distribution was extracellular, R1 exhibited higher values similar to that of 
free ferumoxytol in solution. This finding clearly indicated the intracellular 
localization of ferumoxytol at 24 h, as confirmed by histological analysis 
(Pearls and CD68 assays). This information could be hardly achievable from 
measurements at a single magnetic field and opens new horizons for cell tracking 
applications using FFC-MRI.

MiRNA is a type of small non-coding RNA, by regulating downstream gene 
expression that affects the progression of multiple diseases, especially cancer. 
MiRNA can participate in the biological processes of tumor, including 
proliferation, invasion and escape, and exhibit tumor enhancement or inhibition. 
The tumor immune microenvironment contains numerous immune cells. These cells 
include lymphocytes with tumor suppressor effects such as CD8+ T cells and 
natural killer cells, as well as some tumor-promoting cells with 
immunosuppressive functions, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells. MiRNA can affect the tumor immune microenvironment by 
regulating the function of immune cells, which in turn modulates the progression 
of tumor cells. Investigating the role of miRNA in regulating the tumor immune 
microenvironment will help elucidate the specific mechanisms of interaction 
between immune cells and tumor cells, and may facilitate the use of miRNA as a 
predictor of immune disorders in tumor progression. This review summarizes the 
multifarious roles of miRNA in tumor progression through regulation of the tumor 
immune microenvironment, and provides guidance for the development of miRNA 
drugs to treat tumors and for the use of miRNA as an auxiliary means in tumor 
immunotherapy.

Myeloid cells that infiltrate into brain tumors are deactivated or exploited by 
the tumor cells. We previously demonstrated that compromised microglia, 
monocytes, and macrophages in malignant gliomas could be reactivated by 
amphotericin-B to contain the growth of brain tumorinitiating cells (BTICs). We 
identified meclocycline as another activator of microglia, so we sought to test 
whether its better-tolerated derivative, demeclocycline, also stimulates 
monocytes to restrict BTIC growth. Monocytes were selected for study as they 
would be exposed to demeclocycline in the circulation prior to entry into brain 
tumors to become macrophages. We found that demeclocycline increased the 
activity of monocytes in culture, as determined by tumor necrosis factor-α 
production and chemotactic capacity. The conditioned medium of 
demeclocycline-stimulated monocytes attenuated the growth of BTICs generated 
from human glioblastoma resections, as evaluated using neurosphere and 
alamarBlue assays, and cell counts. Demeclocycline also had direct effects in 
reducing BTIC growth. A global gene expression screen identified several genes, 
such as DNA damage inducible transcript 4, frizzled class receptor 5 and 
reactive oxygen species modulator 1, as potential regulators of 
demeclocycline-mediated BTIC growth reduction. Amongst several tetracycline 
derivatives, only demeclocycline directly reduced BTIC growth. In summary, we 
have identified demeclocycline as a novel inhibitor of the growth of BTICs, 
through direct effect and through indirect stimulation of monocytes. 
Demeclocycline is a candidate to reactivate compromised immune cells to improve 
the prognosis of patients with gliomas.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are crucial components of the tumor 
microenvironment. They play vital roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
progression. However, the interactions between TAMs and HCC cells have not been 
fully characterized. In this study, TAMs were induced using human monocytic cell 
line THP-1 cells in vitro to investigate their functions in HCC progression. 
S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), an inflammatory 
microenvironment-related secreted protein, was identified to be significantly 
upregulated in TAMs. S100A9 expression in tumor tissues was associated with poor 
survival of HCC patients. It could enhance the stem cell-like properties of 
HepG2 and MHCC-97H cells by activating nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway 
through advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor in a Ca2+ 
-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that, after treatment with S100A9, 
HepG2 and MHCC-97H cells recruited more macrophages via chemokine (CC motif) 
ligand 2, which suggests a positive feedback between TAMs and HCC cells. Taken 
together, our findings reveal that TAMs could upregulate secreted protein S100A9 
and enhance the stem cell-like properties of HCC cells and provide a potential 
therapeutic target for combating HCC.

OBJECTIVE: Inflammation and angiogenesis may play a role in the growth of 
sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (VS). 
The similarities in microvascular and inflammatory microenvironment have not 
been investigated. The authors sought to compare the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) in sporadic and NF2-related VSs using a combined imaging and tissue 
analysis approach.
METHODS: Diffusion MRI and high-temporal-resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced 
(DCE) MRI data sets were prospectively acquired in 20 NF2-related and 24 
size-matched sporadic VSs. Diffusion metrics (mean diffusivity, fractional 
anisotropy) and DCE-MRI-derived microvascular biomarkers (transfer constant 
[Ktrans], fractional plasma volume, tissue extravascular-extracellular space 
[ve], longitudinal relaxation rate, tumoral blood flow) were compared across 
both VS groups, and regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of tumor 
size, pretreatment tumor growth rate, and tumor NF2 status (sporadic vs 
NF2-related) on each imaging parameter. Tissues from 17 imaged sporadic VSs and 
a separate cohort of 12 NF2-related VSs were examined with immunohistochemistry 
markers for vessels (CD31), vessel permeability (fibrinogen), and macrophage 
density (Iba1). The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
VEGF receptor 1 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and 
double immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Imaging data demonstrated that DCE-MRI-derived microvascular 
characteristics were similar in sporadic and NF2-related VSs. Ktrans (p < 
0.001), ve (p ≤ 0.004), and tumoral free water content (p ≤ 0.003) increased 
with increasing tumor size and pretreatment tumor growth rate. Regression 
analysis demonstrated that with the exception of mean diffusivity (p < 0.001), 
NF2 status had no statistically significant effect on any of the imaging 
parameters or the observed relationship between the imaging parameters and tumor 
size (p > 0.05). Tissue analysis confirmed the imaging metrics among resected 
sporadic VSs and demonstrated that across all VSs studied, there was a close 
association between vascularity and Iba1+ macrophage density (r = 0.55, p = 
0.002). VEGF was expressed by Iba1+ macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors present the first in vivo comparative study of 
microvascular and inflammatory characteristics in sporadic and NF2-related VSs. 
The imaging and tissue analysis results indicate that inflammation is a key 
contributor to TME and should be viewed as a therapeutic target in both VS 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have elicited promising 
responses in a variety of cancers. However, the relatively low response rates 
warrant the identification of additional immunosuppressive pathways. V domain 
immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) plays a critical role in 
antitumor immunity and is a valuable target in cancer immunotherapy.
METHODS: Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to analyze the gene expression levels 
of 14897 cells from a breast cancer sample and its paired 7,320 normal cells. 
Then, we validated the protein expression of immune checkpoint molecules (VISTA, 
PD-1, PD-L1, TIGIT, TIM3, and LAG3) in 324 human breast cancer samples by 
immunohistochemistry and quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) approaches.
RESULTS: Single cell RNA-seq results show a higher level of immune checkpoint 
VISTA expression in breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. We 
also found that VISTA expressed highest in breast cancer tissue than other 
immune-checkpoints. Immunohistochemical results showed that VISTA was detected 
with a membranous/cytoplasmic staining pattern in intratumoral immune cells and 
breast cancer cells. Additionally, VISTA was positively correlated with 
pathological grade, lymph node status and the levels of PD-1 according to the 
chi-square test or Fisher's test. Furthermore, VISTA expression was higher in 
CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) than in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T 
cells or CD20+ B cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings therefore support the immunoregulatory role of VISTA 
in breast cancer and indicate that targeting VISTA may benefit breast cancer 
immunotherapy.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream regulator of innate 
immunity, but its expression is increased in some cancers via stabilization with 
HSP90-associated chaperones. Here, we show that MIF stabilization is 
tumor-specific in an acute colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse 
model, leading to tumor-specific functions and selective therapeutic 
vulnerabilities. Therefore, we demonstrate that a Mif deletion reduced CRC tumor 
growth. Further, we define a dual role for MIF in CRC tumor progression. Mif 
deletion protects mice from inflammation-associated tumor initiation, confirming 
the action of MIF on host inflammatory pathways; however, macrophage 
recruitment, neoangiogenesis, and proliferative responses are reduced in 
Mif-deficient tumors once the tumors are established. Thus, during neoplastic 
transformation, the function of MIF switches from a proinflammatory cytokine to 
an angiogenesis promoting factor within our experimental model. Mechanistically, 
Mif-containing tumor cells regulate angiogenic gene expression via a 
MIF/CD74/MAPK axis in vitro. Clinical correlation studies of CRC patients show 
the shortest overall survival for patients with high MIF levels in combination 
with CD74 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 to reduce MIF levels 
decreased tumor growth in vivo, and selectively reduced the growth of organoids 
derived from murine and human tumors without affecting organoids derived from 
healthy epithelial cells. Therefore, novel, clinically relevant Hsp90 inhibitors 
provide therapeutic selectivity by interfering with tumorigenic MIF in tumor 
epithelial cells but not in normal cells. Furthermore, Mif-depleted colonic 
tumor organoids showed growth defects compared to wild-type organoids and were 
less susceptible toward HSP90 inhibitor treatment. Our data support that 
tumor-specific stabilization of MIF promotes CRC progression and allows MIF to 
become a potential and selective therapeutic target in CRC.

We investigated the intratumoral source of PD-L1 expression and the infiltration 
of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with or 
without MYC-translocation, as well as possible correlations to BCL2-and 
BCL6-translocations and cell of origin (COO). One-hundred and twenty-six patient 
samples were studied in a cohort enriched for MYC-translocated tumors with 34 
samples carrying this translocation. Demonstration of intratumoral distribution 
and cellular source of PD-L1 was enabled by immunohistochemical (IHC) dual 
staining specifically highlighting PD-L1 expression in lymphoma B-cells with 
antibodies against PD-L1 and PAX5. Additional IHC with antibodies against CD68 
and CD163 identified TAMs. We found that CD68-positive TAMs were the main source 
of PD-L1 protein expression in contrast to lymphoma B cells which rarely 
expressed PD-L1. Semiquantitative IHC demonstrated a significant correlation 
between CD68 and PD-L1 protein expression. Unsupervised hierarchical analysis of 
PD-L1, CD68, and CD163 IHC data subsequently demonstrated three potential 
clusters defined by expression of the three biomarkers. Cluster A consisted of 
patient samples with significantly lower expression of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163, 
but also significantly higher prevalence of BCL2-translocation and 
MYC-BCL2-double-hit (DH) compared to the other two clusters. In cluster C we 
found a significant accumulation of BCL6 translocated tumors. This cluster in 
contrast had the highest protein expression of PD-L1, CD68, and CD163. Cluster B 
tumors had an intermediate expression of the three biomarkers, but no 
accumulation of the specific genetic translocations. Our data, which were based 
on morphological analysis, immunophenotyping and genotyping by fluorescence in 
situ hybridization were in line with new concepts of LBCL taxonomy integrating 
genetic, phenotypical, and immunological characteristics with identification of 
new subgroups where MYC translocation and MYC-BCL2 DH may identify a noninflamed 
subtype. These findings may furthermore hold significant predictive value 
especially regarding immune checkpoint blockade therapy, but further molecular 
characterization should be done to substantiate this hypothesis.

Modulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) holds promise for cancer 
treatment, mainly relying on M1 signaling activation and pro-inflammatory 
promotion. Nevertheless, the antitumor activity is often limited by the 
anti-inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the metabolic 
function of TAMs is also critical to tumor progression. However, there are a few 
strategies that can simultaneously regulate both inflammatory and metabolic 
functions to achieve safe and potent antitumor activation of TAMs. Herein, we 
demonstrate that an iron-based metal organic framework nanoparticle and a 
ferroptosis-inducing agent synergistically induce mitochondrial alternation in 
TAMs, resulting in a radical metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is resistant to anti-inflammatory stimuli 
challenge. The ferroptosis stress strengthened by the nanoformulation also 
drives multiple pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, enabling macrophage 
activation with potent tumoricidal activities. The ferroptosis-strengthened 
macrophage regulation strategy present in this study paves the way for 
TAM-centered antitumoral treatment to overcome the limitations of conventional 
methods.

Targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising strategy to modify 
the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve cancer immunotherapy. 
Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an enzyme best known for its function in the 
brain; small molecule MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are clinically used for treating 
neurological disorders. Here we observe MAO-A induction in mouse and human TAMs. 
MAO-A-deficient mice exhibit decreased TAM immunosuppressive functions 
corresponding with enhanced antitumor immunity. MAOI treatment induces TAM 
reprogramming and suppresses tumor growth in preclinical mouse syngeneic and 
human xenograft tumor models. Combining MAOI and anti-PD-1 treatments results in 
synergistic tumor suppression. Clinical data correlation studies associate high 
intratumoral MAOA expression with poor patient survival in a broad range of 
cancers. We further demonstrate that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive 
polarization via upregulating oxidative stress. Together, these data identify 
MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAMs and support repurposing MAOIs for TAM 
reprogramming to improve cancer immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Small RNAs (sRNAs) extensively mediate gene-specific chromatin 
regulation in lower organisms. As a dominant type of functional sRNAs in mature 
mammals, microRNAs mainly regulate gene expression at post-transcription level 
in the cytoplasm. Currently, whether there exists a type of nuclear-localized 
sRNAs mediating gene-specific epigenetic regulation in mature mammalian cells 
remains largely unclear. Here, we profiled sRNAs enriched in the nucleus and 
investigated their function in mediating gene-specific epigenetic regulation in 
anti-tumor immunity.
METHODS: We established cytoplasmic and nuclear transcriptomes of sRNAs of 
dendritic cells (DCs) using high-throughput sequencing. Transcription abundances 
of sRNAs and mRNAs were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. The associations between sRNAs and 
Argonaute (AGO) proteins were detected by RNA immunoprecipitation analysis. 
Synthesized sRNAs and locked nucleic acid (LNA) -modified sRNA inhibitors were 
used to screen the function of sRNAs in innate immune cells. The effect of sRNA 
on the enrichment of either chromatin remodeler or histone modification at the 
gene promoter was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay. 
Chromatin accessibility qPCR assay was used to detect the accessibility of gene 
promoters. A B16 melanoma-bearing mouse model was established to determine the 
function of sRNAs in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their effect on 
tumor growth.
RESULTS: We identified a new class of nucleus-localized sRNAs, named 
snRNA/snoRNA-derived nuclear RNAs (sdnRNAs). Some sdnRNAs were Dicer-independent 
and had no association with Argonaute proteins. sdnRNA-3, the most abundant 
Dicer-independent sdnRNAs identified in our analysis, was selected as a 
representative to examine the biological function of sdnRNAs. sdnRNA-3 
selectively inhibited the transcription of Nos2 in macrophages during innate 
immune response by repressing the chromatin accessibility at Nos2 gene promoter. 
sdnRNA-3 promoted the enrichments of repressive chromatin-remodeling regulator 
Mi-2β and the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 at Nos2 gene promoter. In 
the B16 melanoma mouse model, we found higher expression of sdnRNA-3 in M2 TAMs 
than M1 TAMs and DCs. Transfer of sdnRNA-3-silenced macrophages inhibited tumor 
growth with increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in 
TAMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that the sdnRNA-3 repressed the 
transcription of Nos2 by repressing chromatin accessibility at the promoter, 
providing new insights into the regulation of macrophage function in tumor 
immunity.

Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) inhibit the killing effect of T lymphocytes 
on tumour cells through the immunocheckpoint programmed death ligand-1 
(PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis. TAMs-targeted therapy is a promising 
approach that could be used to reverse the immunosuppressive tumour 
microenvironment. Here, we further report CMPB90-1, a novel natural 
polysaccharide from Cordyceps militaris, could function as an anti-tumour 
modulator that resets TAMs from a tumour-promoting M2 phenotype to a 
tumour-killing M1 phenotype. This process involves reversing the functional 
inhibition of T lymphocytes by inhibiting the PD-L1/PD-1 axis between TAMs and T 
lymphocytes. Mechanistically, the membrane receptor of CMPB90-1 binding to M2 
macrophages was identified by tandem mass spectrometry. CMPB90-1 converts 
immunosuppressive TAMs via binding to toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which causes 
the release of Ca2+ and the activation of p38, Akt and NF-κB, or ERK. This 
process then leads to the polarization of TAMs from M2 phenotype to the M1 
phenotype. In vivo experiment shows that CMPB90-1 is able to polarize TAMs into 
the M1 phenotype and has anti-tumour effects with improved safety. Additionally, 
the anti-tumour effects of CMPB90-1 in vivo depend on the phenotypic conversion 
of TAMs. The results demonstrated that CMPB90-1 could be developed as a 
potential immune-oncology treatment reagent.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial part in cancer evolution. 
Dynamic imaging of TAMs is of great significance for treatment outcome 
evaluation and precision tumor therapy. Currently, most fluorescence nanoprobes 
tend to accumulate in the liver and are difficult to metabolize, which leads to 
strong background signals and inadequate imaging quality of TAMs nearby the 
liver such as pancreatic cancer. Herein, we aim to develop metabolizable 
dextran-indocyanine green (DN-ICG) nanoprobes in the second near-infrared window 
(NIR-II, 1 000-1 700 nm) for dynamic imaging of TAMs in pancreatic cancer. 
Compared to free ICG, the NIR-II fluorescence intensity of DN-ICG nanoprobes 
increased by 279% with significantly improved stability. We demonstrated that 
DN-ICG nanoprobes could specifically target TAMs through the interaction of 
dextran with specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin related 1 (SIGN-R1), which 
were highly expressed in TAMs. Subsequently, DN-ICG nanoprobes gradually 
metabolized in the liver yet remained in pancreatic tumor stroma in mouse 
models, achieving a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR = 7) in deep tissue 
(∼0.5 cm) NIR-II imaging of TAMs. Moreover, DN-ICG nanoprobes could detect 
dynamic changes of TAMs induced by low-dose radiotherapy and zoledronic acid. 
Therefore, the highly biocompatible and biodegradable DN-ICG nanoprobes harbor 
great potential for precision therapy in pancreatic cancer.

Background Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is aggressive with a poor prognosis, 
partly because of the immunosuppressive microenvironment created by 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Purpose To understand the relationship 
between TAM infiltration, tumor vascularization, and corresponding drug delivery 
by using ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI and macrin in an ATC mouse model. Materials 
and Methods ATC tumors were generated in 6-8-week-old female B6129SF1/J mice 
through intrathyroid injection to model orthotopic tumors, or intravenously to 
model hematogenous metastasis, and prospectively enrolled randomly into 
treatment cohorts (n = 94 total; August 1, 2018, to January 15, 2020). Mice were 
treated with vehicle or combined serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) 
kinase inhibitor (BRAFi) and anti-PDL1 antibody (aPDL1). A subset was cotreated 
with therapies, including an approximately 70-nm model drug delivery 
nanoparticle (DDNP) to target TAM, and an antibody-neutralizing colony 
stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Imaging was performed at the macroscopic 
level with ferumoxytol-MRI and microscopically with macrin. Genetically 
engineered BrafV600E/WT p53-null allografts were used and complemented by a 
GFP-transgenic derivative and human xenografts. Tumor-bearing organs were 
processed by using tissue clearing and imaged with confocal microscopy and MRI. 
Two-tailed Wilcoxon tests were used for comparison (≥five per group). Results 
TAM levels were higher in orthotopic thyroid tumors compared with pulmonary 
metastatic lesions by 79% ± 23 (standard deviation; P < .001). These findings 
were concordant with ferumoxytol MRI, which showed 136% ± 88 higher uptake in 
thyroid lesions (P = .02) compared with lung lesions. BRAFi and aPDL1 
combination therapy resulted in higher tumor DDNP delivery by 39% ± 14 in 
pulmonary lesions (P = .004). Compared with the untreated group, tumors 
following BRAFi, aPDL1, and CSF1R-blocking antibody combination therapy did not 
show greater levels of TAM or DDNP (P = .82). Conclusion In a mouse model of 
anaplastic thyroid cancer, ferumoxytol MRI showed 136% ± 88 greater uptake in 
orthotopic thyroid tumors compared with pulmonary lesions, which reflected high 
vascularization and greater tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) levels. 
Serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf inhibitor and anti-programmed death ligand 
1 antibody elicited higher local TAM levels and 43% ± 20 greater therapeutic 
nanoparticle delivery but not higher vascularization in pulmonary tumors. ©

Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is an aggressive disease characterized by 
late clinical presentation, large tumor size, treatment resistance and low 
survival rate. Expression of EGFR/HER2 and activation of intracellular tyrosine 
kinase domains in LABC are associated with poor prognosis. Thus, target 
therapies such as the anti-receptor tyrosine kinases lapatinib drug have been 
more developed in the past decade. The response to lapatinib involves the 
inhibition of RTKs and subsequently signaling molecules such as Src/STAT3/Erk1/2 
known also to be activated by the cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
The aim of the present study is to identify the major cytokine that might 
contribute to lapatinib resistance in EGFR+/HER2+ LABC patients. Indeed, tumor 
associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main source of cytokines in the TME. 
Herein, we isolated TAMs from LABC during modified radical mastectomy (MRM). 
Cytokine profile of TAMs revealed that IL-8 is the most prominent highly 
secreted cytokine by TAMs of LABC patients. Using in-vitro cell culture model we 
showed that recombinant IL-8 (50 and 100 ng/mL) at different time intervals 
interfere with lapatinib action via activation of Src/EGFR and signaling 
molecules known to be inhibited during treatment. We proposed that to improve 
LABC patients' response to lapatinib treatment it is preferred to use combined 
therapy that neutralize or block the action of IL-8.

Breast cancer is one of the most malignant diseases world-wide and ranks the 
first among female cancers. Progranulin (PGRN) plays a carcinogenic role in 
breast cancer, but its mechanisms are not clear. In addition, there are few 
reports on the relationship between PGRN and tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs).
AIMS: To investigate the effects of exosomes derived from PGRN-/- TAMs on 
invasion and migration of breast cancer cells.
MAIN METHODS: Mouse breast cancer xenograft model was constructed to explore the 
effect of PGRN-/- tumor environment (TME) on breast cancer. Flow cytometry was 
used to compare TAMs of wild type (WT) and PGRN-/- tumor tissue. Transwell 
assay, wound healing assay and western blot were used to explore the effect of 
WT and PGRN-/- TAMs and their exosomes on invasion, migration and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) 
assay was used to find out the differentially expressed miRNA of negative 
control (NC) and siPGRN-TAMs exosomes. Quantitative PCR and luciferase report 
assay were used to explore the target gene.
KEY FINDINGS: The lung metastasis of breast cancer of PGRN-/- mice was 
inhibited. PGRN-/- TAMs inhibited invasion, migration and EMT of breast cancer 
cells through their exosomes. MiR-5100 of PGRN-/- TAMs-derived exosomes was 
up-regulated, which might regulate expression of CXCL12, thereby inhibiting the 
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, and ultimately inhibiting the invasion, migration and EMT of 
breast cancer cells.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study elucidates a new molecular mechanism of lung metastasis 
of breast cancer, so it may contribute to efficient prevention and therapeutic 
strategies.

Current studies indicated that immune-associated genes (IAGs) have important 
roles in the occurrence and development of bladder cancer (BC). The current work 
aims to identify the prognostic values of IAGs in BC and establish a prognostic 
signature based on IAGs. RNA sequencing data and protein expression data were 
used to identify differentially expressed IAGs in BC. An IAGs based signature 
was further constructed and the prognostic and predictive values of the 
signature were evaluated by survival analysis and nomogram. RNA isolation and 
reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were further performed to 
investigate the expression levels of IAGs in BC cells and were used to explore 
the relationship between IAGs and M2 tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
secreted transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in BC cells. We selected five 
IAGs to develop an IAGs signature model, which were significantly related to 
survival outcomes of BC patients. RT-qPCR showed that five IAGs were 
significantly differentially expressed and three IAGs were positively correlated 
with M2 TAMs secreted TGF-β1 in T24 cells. We identified and validated an IAGs 
based signature to predict the prognosis of BC patients. Furthermore, M2 TAMs 
may promote the expression of IAGs in BC via the TGF-β1 signalling pathway.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common high-mortality cancer, mainly due to 
diagnostic difficulties during its early clinical stages. In this study, we 
aimed to identify genes that are important for HCC diagnosis and treatment, and 
we investigated the underlying mechanism of prognostic differences. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using the limma 
package, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to 
identify diagnostic markers for HCC. Bioinformatics and clinical specimens were 
used to assess epithelial cell transforming 2 (ECT2) in terms of expression, 
prognostic value, pathways, and immune correlations. In vitro experiments were 
used to investigate the underlying mechanism and function of ECT2, and the 
results were confirmed through in vivo experiments. The integrated analysis 
revealed 53 upregulated DEGs, and one candidate biomarker for diagnosis (ECT2) 
was detected. High expression of ECT2 was found to be an independent prognostic 
risk factor for HCC. ECT2 expression showed a strong correlation with 
tumor-associated macrophages. We found that ECT2 overexpression increased the 
migration and proliferation of HCC cells. It also promoted the expression of 
PLK1, which subsequently interacted with PTEN and interfered with its nuclear 
translocation, ultimately enhancing aerobic glycolysis and promoting M2 
macrophage polarization. M2 macrophages suppress the functions of NK cells and T 
cells, and this was confirmed in the in vivo experiments. Overall, ECT2 may 
promote the polarization of M2 macrophages by enhancing aerobic glycolysis and 
suppressing the functions of immune cells. ECT2 could serve as a candidate 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC.

As substantial constituents of the multiple myeloma (MM) microenvironment, 
pro-inflammatory macrophages have emerged as key promoters of disease 
progression, bone destruction, and immune impairment. We identify 
beta-2-microglobulin (β2m) as a driver in initiating inflammation in 
myeloma-associated macrophages (MAMs). Lysosomal accumulation of phagocytosed 
β2m promotes β2m amyloid aggregation in MAMs, resulting in lysosomal rupture and 
ultimately production of active interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. This process 
depends on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome after β2m accumulation, as 
macrophages from NLRP3-deficient mice lack efficient β2m-induced IL-1β 
production. Moreover, depletion or silencing of β2m in MM cells abrogates 
inflammasome activation in a murine MM model. Finally, we demonstrate that 
disruption of NLRP3 or IL-18 diminishes tumor growth and osteolytic bone 
destruction normally promoted by β2m-induced inflammasome signaling. Our results 
provide mechanistic evidence for β2m's role as an NLRP3 inflammasome activator 
during MM pathogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of NLRP3 represents a potential 
therapeutic approach in MM.

BACKGROUND: TNFSF9 gene has been found to play an anti-tumor role and regulate 
the function of immune cells. However, the prognostic role of TNFSF9 in 
pancreatic cancer and its relationship with immune cell infiltration have not 
been studied.
METHODS: We used Oncomine, UALCAN, and GEPIA databases to analyze the expression 
of TNFSF9 in pancreatic cancer. We used Kaplan-Meier plotters, GEPIA, and UALCAN 
to evaluate the effect of TNFSF9 on clinical prognosis. We further used TIMER to 
study the correlation between TNFSF9 and cancer immune infiltrate cells. In 
addition, we used GEPIA to analyze the correlation between TNFSF9 expression and 
gene markers of immune infiltrate cells.
RESULTS: TNFSF9 mRNA expression level was remarkably increased in pancreatic 
cancer than that in normal tissues (both P < 0.05). In addition, high TNFSF9 
expression was significantly related to poor overall survival (OS) and 
relapse-free survival (RFS) in pancreatic cancer (OS HR = 2.02, P = 0.0012; RFS 
HR = 2.63, P = 0.022). Moreover, high TNFSF9 expression in pancreatic cancer 
patients was associated with worse OS in stage 1 to 2 but not stage 3 and stage 
4. Specifically, TNFSF9 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration of pancreatic 
cancer was negatively correlated. TNFSF9 expression showed strong correlations 
with M1 macrophages in pancreatic cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNFSF9 is associated with prognosis and 
CD8+ T cell infiltration levels in patients with pancreatic cancer. Further, 
TNFSF9 expression potentially contributes to the modulation of M1 polarization 
of macrophages. These findings indicate that TNFSF9 can be serves as a 
prognostic biomarker in determining the prognosis of pancreatic cancer and is 
associated with different types of phenotypes of immune cell infiltration.

Radiotherapy (RT)-induced tumoricidal immunity is severely limited when tumors 
are well-established. Here, we report that depleting SIRPα on intratumoral 
macrophages augments efficacy of RT to eliminate otherwise large, 
treatment-resistant colorectal (MC38) and pancreatic (Pan02 and KPC) tumors, 
inducing complete abscopal remission and long-lasting humoral and cellular 
immunity that prevent recurrence. SIRPα-deficient macrophages activated by 
irradiated tumor-released DAMPs exhibit robust efficacy and orchestrate an 
anti-tumor response that controls late-stage tumors. Upon RT-mediated 
activation, intratumoral SIRPα-deficient macrophages acquire potent 
proinflammatory features and conduct immunogenic antigen presentation that 
confer a tumoricidal microenvironment highly infiltrated by tumor-specific 
cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and inflammatory neutrophils, but with limited 
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells and 
post-radiation wound-healing. The results demonstrate that SIRPα is a master 
regulator underlying tumor resistance to RT and provide proof-of-principle for 
SIRPα-deficient macrophage-based therapies to treat a broad spectrum of cancers, 
including those at advanced stages with low immunogenicity and metastases.

Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1) is known to have a broad 
range of actions on myeloid cells maturation, including the regulation of 
macrophage differentiation, proliferation and survival. Macrophages generated by 
M-CSF stimulus have been proposed to be alternatively activated or M2 phenotype. 
M-CSF is commonly overexpressed by tumors and is also known to enhance tumor 
growth and aggressiveness via stimulating pro-tumor activities of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Currently, inhibition of CSF-1/CSF-1R 
interaction by therapeutic antibody to deplete TAMs and their pro-tumor 
functions is becoming a prevalent strategy in cancer therapy. However, its 
antitumor activity shows a limited single-agent effect. Therefore, macrophages 
in response to M-CSF interruption are pending for further investigation. To 
achieve this study, bone marrow derived macrophages were generated in vitro by 
M-CSF stimulation for 7 days and then continuously grown until day 21 in M-CSF 
absence. A selective pressure for cell survival was initiated after withdrawal 
of M-CSF. The surviving cells were more prone to M2-like phenotype, even after 
receiving interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation. The transcriptome analysis unveiled 
that endogenous CSF-1 level was dramatically up-regulated and numerous genes 
downstream to CSF-1 covering tumor necrosis factor (TNF), ras-related protein 1 
(Rap1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling 
pathway were significantly modulated, especially for proliferation, migration 
and adhesion. Moreover, the phenomenal increase of miR-21-5p and genes related 
to pro-tumor activity were observed in parallel. In summary, withholding of 
CSF-1/CSF-1R interaction would rather augment than suspend the M-CSF-driven 
pro-tumor activities of M2 macrophages in a long run.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is among the most aggressive malignant 
tumors in humans. Although AHNAK nucleoprotein 2 (AHNAK2) is considered a new 
oncogene, the function of the AHNAK2 in LUAD remains unknown.
METHODS: Oncomine, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and Human Protein 
Atlas databases were used to investigate AHNAK2 expression in LUAD. Gene 
Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases 
were employed to elucidate the relationship between AHNAK2 and survival time. 
Data of The Cancer Genome Atlas were downloaded to analyze the correlation 
between AHNAK2 and clinicopathological parameters. We then immunohistochemically 
stained tissue chips to further confirm the correlation and conducted Gene 
Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein 
interaction network analyses to explore the possible functional mechanism of 
AHNAK2. Finally, we investigated the relationship between AHNAK2 and tumor 
infiltrating immune cells (TIICs).
RESULTS: AHNAK2 gene was significantly overexpressed in LUAD tumor tissues and 
an independent prognostic indicator of LUAD patients. The expression of AHNAK2 
was related to disease stage, differentiation, tumor size and lymph node 
metastasis. We found AHNAK2 expression was mainly positively correlated with 
cell adhesion-related pathways and negatively correlated with oxidative 
phosphorylation and amino acid metabolism. AHNAK2 expression was also negatively 
correlated with activated B cell, activated CD8 + T cell, and immature B cell 
infiltrates and positively correlated with central memory CD4 + T cell, 
tumor-associated macrophage, M1 macrophage, and M2 macrophage infiltrates.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide strong evidence of AHNAK2 expression as a 
prognostic indicator related to TIICs in LUAD.

Tumor associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment secrete multiple 
cytokines, which regulate cancer cells growth and invasiveness. We 
systematically studied the role of cytokines in the induction of cancer stem 
like cells (CSCs) in oral cancer cells niche and evaluated the mechanism of 
Resveratrol nanoparticle (Res-Nano) mediated-reduction of CSCs properties in 
cells. A highly M1-like macrophages-enriched conditioned medium (CM) was 
generated by treating fixed doses of PMA and LPS in THP-1 cells alone as well as 
co-cultured of H-357 plus THP-1 cells. These M1-like macrophages increased the 
production of cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, etc.). A CSCs populated 
environment was created after addition of cytokine-enriched-CM of co-culture of 
H-357 and THP-1 cells to cancer cells and cytokine enriched CM of THP-1 cells to 
patient derived primary oral cancer cells, respectively. After incubation with 
CM, enhancement of stemness, angiogenic and metastatic properties of both H-357 
and primary oral cancer cells were noted. Res-NP decreased the cytokines level 
in CSCs-enriched cells and reduced the invasion, proliferation and growth of 
CSCs. Representative metastatic (CD133, ALDH1, CXCR4, etc.) and angiogenic 
markers (MMPs, iNOS, VEGF-A, etc.) were decreased after Res-NP treatment in CSCs 
enriched oral cancer cells niche. It also disrupted angiogenesis, depleted 
nitric oxide production in fertilized chick embryos and reduced the expression 
of metastatic and angiogenic markers in xenograft mice model system. Thus, this 
study concluded that CSCs-mediated stemness is a cytokine dependent phenomena 
and treatment of Res-NP inhibit this process in in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo 
systems.

Insufficient drug accumulation and chemoresistance remain two major challenges 
in cancer chemotherapy. Herein, we designed a furin-responsive aggregated 
nanoplatform loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 
(AuNPs-D&H-R&C) to combine chemotherapy, autophagy inhibition and macrophage 
polarization. AuNPs-D&H-R&C could passively target breast tumor via enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) effect after systemic administration and 
further aggregate together triggered by furin overexpressed in breast cancer. 
The in situ aggregations hindered the back-flow of NPs to the bloodstream and 
exocytosis of tumor cells, leading to enhanced drug accumulation within tumors. 
Moreover, upon exposure to acidic pH in the endosomes/lysosomes, HCQ was 
efficiently released and it inhibited autophagy and thus restored the 
sensitivity of tumor cell to DOX. Meanwhile, autophagy inhibition could 
reprogram tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs to anti-tumor M1 phenotype, exerting a 
synergistic effect in overcoming chemoresistance. In vitro studies demonstrated 
the superiority of furin-triggered aggregated AuNPs delivery system in enhancing 
drug accumulation in breast tumor, compared with PEGlyated AuNPs. The 
co-delivery of DOX and HCQ showed much improved chemotherapeutic efficiency to 
chemoresistant MCF-7/ADR breast tumor, in large part due to macrophage 
polarization. In conclusion, we developed a stimulus-responsive delivery system 
and proposed a potential combination strategy to overcome chemoresistance in 
cancer chemotherapy.

PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor expression was evaluated in high-grade serous 
carcinoma (HGSC) ovary in the context of the overall immune landscape to 
determine its prognostic value. Consecutive cases of HGSC, 50 who underwent 
upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (HGSC-U) and 50 who underwent 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (HGSC-PC) 
were selected. In HGSC-PC cases, the pre-NACT ascitic fluid cell blocks were 
included. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were scored, hotspots chosen for 
tissue microarray construction and immunohistochemistry performed and scored for 
CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets, CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), PD-1 
and PD-L1 expression. HGSC-post-chemotherapy showed increased TILs, 
predominantly CD8+T-lymphocytes, compared to HGSC-U. HGSC showed PD-L1 
expression on tumor cells and/or TAMs in 60% cases with a linear correlation to 
CD4+, CD8+ TIL levels. Concordant PD-L1 expression was seen in matched pre- and 
post-NACT tumor cells. HGSC-PC showed higher expression of PD-L1. There was no 
association of PD-L1 cumulative proportion score or tumor cell score with 
outcome. Taking a cutoff for PD-L1 CPS at 10%, immunotype I (PD-L1+/CD-8+), 
corresponding to tumors with adaptive immune evasion, showed worst disease-free 
survival compared to all other immunotypes (p = 0.03) and was more significant 
(p = 0.01) when compared to immunotype III (PD-L1+/CD8-). Immunotyping based on 
PD-L1/CD8+ expression correlates to prognosis and outcome.

Macrophages represent not only the first line of defense against pathogens and 
are the main drivers of inflammation but are also involved in the initiation, 
immune evasion as well as metastasis of tumors. Therefore, it has been suggested 
that diminishing the immune regulatory function of macrophages would support the 
natural immune surveillance or antitumor therapies, respectively. However, the 
plasticity of macrophages represents an obstacle in understanding and 
manipulating the role of macrophages in tumor tissue or the tumor 
microenvironment. Here, we describe a protocol to differentiate macrophages, 
based on changing their metabolic environment, from bone marrow precursors to 
tumor-associated macrophage-like cells of an immune suppressive phenotype. Based 
on these protocols, the inhibitory functional phenotype of macrophages can be 
manipulated and therefore further analyzed as described, by interrupting 
metabolic pathways.

Metastasis, particularly hematogenous metastasis, is associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with cervical cancer. The lungs are the most common site 
for hematogenous metastasis of cervical cancer. The currently available 
therapeutic modalities, including surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy do not 
provide satisfactory clinical outcome for patients with pulmonary metastases. 
Therefore, it is necessary to investigate an alternative efficacious treatment 
modality. Therapeutic vaccines may evoke tumor-specific immune responses in 
patients to attack tumor cells, representing an attractive treatment option for 
controlling metastatic tumors. Our previous study demonstrated that a single 
administration of a human papillomavirus 16 E7 peptide vaccine, adjuvanted with 
unmethylated CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides, induced the clearance of subcutaneous 
xenograft cervical cancer. In this study, we investigated the anti-metastases 
responses induced by this vaccine using a murine model of pulmonary metastases 
from cervical cancer. The results showed that subcutaneous administration of the 
vaccine inhibited the growth of pulmonary metastases, which may be attributed to 
the increased infiltration of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and decreased number of 
immunosuppressive cells (including myeloid-derived suppressive cells and 
tumor-associated macrophages) in the lungs. Meanwhile, the alteration in a panel 
of cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases induced by the 
vaccination may contribute to the re-modulation of the local suppressive 
environment and inhibition of pulmonary metastases. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy of the vaccine formula 
against murine pulmonary metastases from cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer heterogeneity is an essential element that plays a 
role in the therapy response variability and the patient's outcome. This 
highlights the need for more precise subtyping methods that focus not only on 
tumor cells but also investigate the profile of stromal cells as well as immune 
cells.
OBJECTIVES: To mine publicly available transcriptomic breast cancer datasets and 
reanalyze their transcriptomic profiling using unsupervised clustering in order 
to identify novel subsets in molecular subtypes of breast cancer, then explore 
the stromal and immune cells profile in each subset using bioinformatics and 
systems immunology approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transcriptomic data from 1,084 breast cancer patients 
obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were extracted and 
subjected to unsupervised clustering using a recently described, multi-step 
algorithm called Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS). For each 
cluster, the stromal and immune profile was investigated using ESTIMATE and 
CIBERSORT analytical tool. Clinical outcomes and differentially expressed genes 
of the characterized clusters were identified and validated in silico and in 
vitro in a cohort of 80 breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Seven unique sub-clusters showed distinct molecular and clinical 
profiles between the well-known breast cancer subtypes. Those unsupervised 
clusters identified more homogenous subgroups in each of the classical subtypes 
with a different prognostic profile. Immune profiling of the identified clusters 
showed that while the classically activated macrophages (M1) are correlated with 
the more aggressive basal-like breast cancer subtype, the alternatively 
activated macrophages (M2) showed a higher level of infiltration in luminal A 
and luminal B subtypes. Indeed, patients with higher levels of M1 expression 
showed less advanced disease and better patient outcomes presented as prolonged 
overall survival. Moreover, the M1 high basal-like breast cancer group showed a 
higher expression of interferon-gamma induced chemokines and guanylate-binding 
proteins (GBPs) involved in immunity against microbes.
CONCLUSION: Adding immune profiling using transcriptomic data can add precision 
for diagnosis and prognosis and can cluster patients according to the available 
modalities of therapy in a more personalized approach.

Background: Immunotherapy has profoundly changed the landscape of cancer 
management and represented the most significant breakthrough. Yet, it is a 
formidable challenge that the majority of cancers - the so-called "cold" tumors 
- poorly respond to immunotherapy. To find a general immunoregulatory modality 
that can be applied to a broad spectrum of cancers is an urgent need. Methods: 
Magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) possesses promise in cancer therapy. We develop a 
safe and effective therapeutic strategy by using magnetism-mediated targeting 
MHT-immunotherapy in "cold" colon cancer. A magnetic liposomal system modified 
with cell-penetrating TAT peptide was developed for targeted delivery of a CSF1R 
inhibitor (BLZ945), which can block the CSF1-CSF1R pathway and reduce M2 
macrophages. The targeted delivery strategy is characterized by its magnetic 
navigation and TAT-promoting intratumoral penetration. Results: The liposomes 
(termed TAT-BLZmlips) can induce ICD and cause excessive CRT exposure on the 
cell surface, which transmits an "eat-me" signal to DCs to elicit immunity. The 
combination of MHT and BLZ945 can repolarize M2 macrophages in the tumor 
microenvironment to relieve immunosuppression, normalize the tumor blood 
vessels, and promote T-lymphocyte infiltration. The antitumor effector CD8+ T 
cells were increased after treatment. Conclusion: This work demonstrated that 
TAT-BLZmlips with magnetic navigation and MHT can remodel tumor microenvironment 
and activate immune responses and memory, thus inhibiting tumor growth and 
recurrence.

Rationale: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) against the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
showed limited success in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 
especially in those with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
mutations. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying EGFR-mediated tumor immune 
escape and the development of effective immune therapeutics are urgently needed. 
Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 4, a crucial immunosuppressive molecule 
initially identified in myeloid cells, is enriched in solid tumor cells and 
promotes the malignant behavior of NSCLC. However, the upstream regulation of 
ILT4 overexpression and its function in tumor immunity of NSCLC with EGFR 
activation remains unclear. Methods: ILT4 expression and EGFR phosphorylation in 
human NSCLC tissues and cell lines were analyzed using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. 
The molecular signaling for EGFR-regulated ILT4 expression was investigated 
using mRNA microarray and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analyses and 
then confirmed by Western blotting. The regulation of tumor cell proliferation 
and apoptosis by ILT4 was examined by CCK8 proliferation and apoptosis assays. 
The impact of ILT4 and PD-L1 on tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment 
and polarization was evaluated using Transwell migration assay, flow cytometry, 
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time PCR, while their impact 
on T cell survival and cytotoxicity was analyzed by CFSE proliferation assay, 
apoptotic assay, flow cytometry, ELISA and cytolytic assay. Tumor immunotherapy 
models targeting at paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B, an ortholog of ILT4 in 
mouse)/ILT4 and/or PD-L1 were established in C57BL/6 mice inoculated with stable 
EGFR- overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and in humanized NSG mice 
inoculated with EGFR mutant, gefitinib-resistant PC9 (PC9-GR) or 
EGFR-overexpressing wild type H1299 cells. PIR-B and ILT4 inhibition was 
implemented by infection of specific knockdown lentivirus and PD-L1 was blocked 
using human/mouse neutralizing antibodies. The tumor growth model was 
established in NSG mice injected with PIR-B-downregulated LLC cells to evaluate 
the effect of PIR-B on tumor proliferation. The frequencies and phenotypes of 
macrophages and T cells in mouse spleens and blood were detected by flow 
cytometry while those in tumor tissues were determined by IHC and 
immunofluorescence. Results: We found that ILT4 expression in tumor cells was 
positively correlated with EGFR phosphorylation in human NSCLC tissues. Using 
NSCLC cell lines, we demonstrated that ILT4 was upregulated by both tyrosine 
kinase mutation-induced and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent EGFR 
activation and subsequent AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Overexpressed ILT4 in 
EGFR-activated tumor cells induced TAM recruitment and M2-like polarization, 
which impaired T cell function. ILT4 also directly inhibited T cell 
proliferation, cytotoxicity, and IFN-γ expression and secretion. In 
EGFR-activated cell lines in vitro and in wild-type EGFR-activated C57BL/6 and 
humanized NSG immunotherapy models in vivo, either ILT4 (PIR-B) or PD-L1 
inhibition enhanced anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression by 
counteracting TAM- and dysfunctional T cell- induced immuno-suppressive TME; the 
combined inhibition of both molecules showed the most dramatic tumor retraction. 
Surprisingly, in EGFR mutant, TKI resistant humanized NSG immunotherapy model, 
ILT4 inhibition alone rather than in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor 
suppressed tumor growth and immune evasion. Conclusions: ILT4 was induced by 
activation of EGFR-AKT and ERK1/2 signaling in NSCLC cells. Overexpressed ILT4 
suppressed tumor immunity by recruiting M2-like TAMs and impairing T cell 
response, while ILT4 inhibition prevented immunosuppression and tumor promotion. 
Furthermore, ILT4 inhibition enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitor in EGFR 
wild-type but not in EGFR mutant NSCLC. Our study identified novel mechanisms 
for EGFR-mediated tumor immune escape, and provided promising immunotherapeutic 
strategies for patients with EGFR-activated NSCLC.

The aim of this study was to examine whether lymphatic invasion in papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) occurs when tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) injure 
lymphatic vessels together with cancer cells. While there was no difference in 
the lymphatic vessel density in PTC and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), the 
number of TAMs around the lymphatic vessels was increased in PTC compared to 
that in FTC. In particular, TAMs were observed together with cancer cells in 
lymphatic invasive lesions, and the number of M2 cells inside and outside the 
lymphatic vessels showed a significant correlation. MMP-2 mRNA was expressed in 
nonneoplastic stromal cells as well as cancer cells, and double 
immunofluorescence staining confirmed M2 positivity. Consequently, this study 
reveals that M2 TAMs around lymphatic vessels within the tumour border of PTC 
may be associated with the lymphatic invasion of cancer cells. This study 
represents a step forward in elucidating the mechanism of lymphatic invasion.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
in women worldwide. The identification of effective markers for early diagnosis 
and prognosis is important for reducing mortality and ensuring that therapy for 
BC is effective. Dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) is a regulator of 
mitochondrial fission. However, the prognostic value of DRP1 and its association 
with immune infiltration in BC remain unknown.
METHODS: The TCGA, Oncomine, UALCAN and HPA databases were used to examine DRP1 
expression in BC. Kaplan-Meier plotter and PrognoScan were used to evaluate the 
association of DRP1 with the prognosis of patients with BC. The mechanism was 
investigated with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) analyses, and the relationship between DRP1 expression and immune 
infiltration in BC was investigated using the TIMER database and CIBERSORT 
algorithm.
RESULTS: DRP1 expression was significantly upregulated in BC compared to healthy 
breast tissues. In addition, elevated DRP1 expression was associated with 
various clinicopathological parameters. High DRP1 expression was significantly 
correlated with poor survival of BC patients. GO and KEGG analyses indicated 
that DRP1 was closely correlated with various signaling pathways and immune 
response. Functional analyses revealed that DRP1 was positively correlated with 
infiltration levels of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Moreover, DRP1 affected the prognosis of BC 
patients partially via immune infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DRP1 is a marker of poor prognosis in 
patients with BC and plays an important role in tumor-related immune 
infiltration.

The bone marrow niche has a pivotal role in progression, survival, and drug 
resistance of multiple myeloma cells. Therefore, it is important to develop 
means for targeting the multiple myeloma bone marrow microenvironment. 
Myeloma-associated macrophages (MAM) in the bone marrow niche are M2 like. They 
provide nurturing signals to multiple myeloma cells and promote immune escape. 
Reprogramming M2-like macrophages toward a tumoricidal M1 phenotype represents 
an intriguing therapeutic strategy. This is especially interesting in view of 
the successful use of mAbs against multiple myeloma cells, as these therapies 
hold the potential to trigger macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and cytotoxicity. 
In this study, we observed that MAMs derived from patients treated with the 
immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) lenalidomide skewed phenotypically and functionally 
toward an M1 phenotype. Lenalidomide is known to exert its beneficial effects by 
modulating the CRBN-CRL4 E3 ligase to ubiquitinate and degrade the transcription 
factor IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1). In M2-like MAMs, we observed 
enhanced IKZF1 levels that vanished through treatment with lenalidomide, 
yielding MAMs with a bioenergetic profile, T-cell stimulatory properties, and 
loss of tumor-promoting capabilities that resemble M1 cells. We also provide 
evidence that IMiDs interfere epigenetically, via degradation of IKZF1, with IFN 
regulatory factors 4 and 5, which in turn alters the balance of M1/M2 
polarization. We validated our observations in vivo using the CrbnI391V mouse 
model that recapitulates the IMiD-triggered IKZF1 degradation. These data show a 
role for IKZF1 in macrophage polarization and can provide explanations for the 
clinical benefits observed when combining IMiDs with therapeutic antibodies.See

BACKGROUND: Integrin Subunit Alpha 5 (ITGA5), belongs to the integrin alpha 
chain family, is vital for promoting cancer cell invasion, metastasis. However, 
the correlation between ITGA5 expression and immune infiltration in 
gastrointestinal tumors remain unclear.
METHODS: The expression level of ITGA5 was detected by Oncomine and Tumor Immune 
Estimation Resource (TIMER). The association between ITGA5 and prognosis of 
patients was identified by Kaplan-Meier plotter, Gene Expression Profiling 
Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) and PrognoScan. We evaluated the correlation 
between ITGA5 expression and immune infiltrating level via TIMER. Besides, 
TIMER, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and western blot were used to explore 
correlations between ITGA5 expression and markers of immune infiltrates cells. 
Furthermore, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and 
performed functional enrichment by GeneMANIA and Metascape.
RESULTS: ITGA5 was generally overexpressed and correlated with worse prognosis 
in multiple types of gastrointestinal tumors. In addition, ITGA5 expression 
level was significantly associated with tumor purity and immune infiltration 
levels of different immune cells in gastrointestinal tumors. Interestingly, 
immune markers for monocytes, tumor - associated macrophages (TAMs), macrophages 
2 (M2) cells and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells were found to be significantly and 
positively correlated with ITGA5 expression levels in colon and gastric cancer. 
Results from IHC staining and western blot further proved that markers of Th2 
and M2 cell were significantly increased in gastric cancer patients with high 
ITGA5 expression levels. Lastly, interaction network and function enrichment 
analysis revealed ITGA5 was mainly involved in "integrin mediated signaling 
pathway", "leukocyte migration", "cell-substrate adhesion".
CONCLUTIONS: Our study demonstrated that ITGA5 may act as an essential regulator 
of tumor immune cell infiltration and a valuable prognostic biomarker in 
gastrointestinal tumors. Additional work is needed to fully elucidate the 
underlying mechanisms behind these observations.

MIBC (muscle invasive bladder cancer) only accounts for only a minority of 
bladder cancers, however, the disease-specific and overall survival rates of 
patients with MIBC are low. Macrophage M2 polarization has been reported to be 
associated with poorer prognosis in bladder cancer. Through cancer 
bioinformatics and experimental analyses, FGF9 was found to be upregulated in 
MIBC tissues. FGF9 knockdown in T24 cells strongly suppressed the viability, 
migratory capacity, and invasive capacity of cells; culture with medium from 
FGF9 knockdown T24 cells (si-FGF9-CM) significantly inhibited macrophage M2 
polarization, while promoting M1 polarization. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
LINC01140 was positively correlated with FGF9 and was significantly upregulated 
in MIBC tissues. LINC01140 knockdown inhibited the viability, migratory capacity 
and invasive capacity of T24 cells; culture in si-LINC01140-CM also inhibited 
macrophage M2 polarization, while promoting M1 polarization. LINC01140 targeted 
miR-140-5p, while miR-140-5p targeted FGF9 to form a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis. The 
effects of miR-140-5p inhibition on bladder cancer aggressiveness and macrophage 
M2 polarization were opposite to those of LINC01140 or FGF9 knockdown; 
additionally, miR-140-5p inhibition partially reversed the effects of LINC01140 
knockdown on FGF9 protein levels, bladder cancer phenotype, and macrophage M2 
polarization. In conclusion, LINC01140, miR-140-5p, and FGF9 form a 
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis that modulates the bladder cancer phenotype, affects 
macrophage M2 polarization through the tumor microenvironment, and in turn 
affects bladder cancer cell aggressiveness.

The survival of young children (under 5 years of age) with malignant 
retinoblastoma remains poor, and clarification of the mechanism underlying 
tumour development is urgently needed. The present study aimed to reveal the 
role of exosomes (EXOs) from retinoblastoma cells in tumour development. The 
in vitro data indicated that EXOs derived from WERI‑Rb1 cells significantly 
inhibited the antitumour activity of macrophages and induced bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells to promote tumour growth via an increase in monocyte 
chemotactic protein 1 (also known as C‑C motif chemokine ligand 2) levels. 
In vivo data from a xenotransplantation model also showed that EXOs infiltrated 
the spleen, which induced a decrease in leukocytes and natural killer (NK) 
cells. Accordingly, the proportion of tumour‑associated macrophages was 
increased and the proportion of NK cells was decreased in tumours injected with 
EXOs compared with those injected with the control. EXOs were absorbed by 
Kupffer cells, and more metastases were observed in the liver. Thus, these 
results suggested that EXOs derived from retinoblastoma promoted tumour 
progression by infiltrating the microenvironment. Moreover, microRNAs (miRs), 
including miR‑92a, miR‑20a, miR‑129a and miR‑17, and C‑X‑C chemokine receptor 
type 4 and thrombospondin‑1 were detectable in EXOs, which might account for 
EXO‑mediated tumour deterioration.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent studies have indicated the clinical significance of 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in breast cancer; however, the detailed 
mechanisms of cell-cell interactions between TAMs and cancer cells remain 
unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro cell culture studies using human 
monocyte-derived macrophages and breast cancer cell lines were performed to test 
which cytokines would be involved in cell-cell interactions between cancer cells 
and macrophages. In addition, studies using human resected samples and animal 
breast cancer models were performed to examine the significance of TAMs in 
cancer development.
RESULTS: Osteopontin, HB-EGF, and IL-6 were suggested to be macrophage-derived 
growth factors for breast cancer cells. FROUNT inhibitor significantly blocked 
TAM infiltration and subcutaneous tumor growth in an E0771 mouse breast cancer 
model.
CONCLUSION: TAMs express growth factors, such as osteopontin, for cancer cells, 
and targeting of TAM infiltration might be a promising approach for anti-breast 
cancer therapy.

Rationale: Some studies have shown that the local activation of immunogenic cell 
death (ICD) by upregulating calreticulin (CRT) expression in solid tumors can 
improve antitumor effects. Although a promising approach, a key current 
challenge in ICD tumor therapy is the absence of a clinically translatable 
method for reproducibly inducing the CRT expression. Herein, we report a novel 
calreticulin-nanoparticle (CRT-NP) that enhances ICD and synergizes with focused 
ultrasound (FUS) to achieve local and systemic antitumor effects. Methods: 
Full-length clone DNA of calreticulin was encapsulated in NPs made from DOTAP 
and cholesterol. Three CRT-NP intratumoral injections of 20 µg each were given 2 
days apart, and FUS heating (42-45°C, ~15min) was applied sequentially 24h after 
each injection to induce ICD. To investigate ICD specific immune effect, the 
splenocytes of mice vaccinated with CRT-NP (± FUS) treated B16F10 cells were 
evaluated ex-vivo for TRP-2 antigen specific immunity. Additionally, the 
long-term protection was evaluated by re-challenging with the melanoma cells in 
the flank regions of tumor bearing mice. Results: CRT-NP plus FUS (CFUS) 
upregulated CRT expression, expanded the population of melanoma TRP-2 specific 
functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and tumor-suppressing M1 phenotype, and 
increased PD-1 and PD-L1 marker expression in the T cells. Therapeutically, CFUS 
suppressed B16 melanoma growth by >85% vs. that seen in untreated controls, and 
>~50% vs. CRT-NP or FUS alone, and prevented tumor growth in distal untreated 
sites. Conclusions: CRT-NP amplifies the FUS and ICD therapeutic outcomes 
against melanoma, suggesting that the proposed combinatorial methodology may be 
clinically translatable.

Prognostic Value of Tumor Associated Macrophage Markers CD163 and CD68 
Immunohistochemistry in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Rashed RA, Zaki MAM, Mohamed NAW, Mansou OM, Refaey FAHE.

BACKGROUND: Tumor associated macrophages have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and have been suggested to have a 
negative impact on outcome. The aim of this study is to determine the expression 
and the prognostic impact of CD163 and CD68 markers of the tumor associated 
macrophages, in the initial positively infiltrated bone marrow biopsy specimens 
of our subjects by immunohistochemistry and to corre¬late their expression with 
other clinical and laboratory prognostic factors.
METHODS: This study was conducted on fifty-one patients with de novo classical 
Hodgkin's lymphoma, presenting to the Clinical Pathology Department at the 
National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. CD163 and CD68 were detected in the 
initial bone marrow biopsy specimens from our subjects by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The present study included 51 patients with CHL. They comprised 24 
males (47.1%) and 27 females (52.9%) with an age of 32.9 ± 14.5 years. After 
treatment, 33 patients (64.7%) achieved complete remission while 18 patients 
(35.3%) failed. Comparison between patients with CR and patients without 
revealed significantly lower CD68 expression [median (IQR): 30.0 (15.0 - 47.5%) 
versus 55.0 (43.8 - 55.0%), p = 0.003] and CD163 expression [25.0 (10.0 - 37.5%) 
versus 45.0 (0.35 - 55.0%)] in CR patients. Binary logistic regression analysis 
identified CD68 and CD163 expressions as significant predictors of CR in 
univariate and multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of both tumor-associated markers, CD68 and CD163, 
are significant predictors of CR in patients with CHL.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the inflammatory millieu in oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC) tumors and the influence of macrophages related-cytokines on the tumor 
cell migration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammatory protein profile and macrophage population 
(M2/M1 ratio) of human OSCC fragments were analyzed by proteomic analysis and 
flow cytometry assay respectively. To evaluate the effects of inflammation on 
OSCC behavior, we analyzed the role of polarized macrophages and cytokines 
(IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α) on OSCC cell lines (SCC25 and Cal27) responsiveness by 
western blotting (cell signaling) and time-lapse (cell migration). Also, it was 
addressed the crosstalk of IL-6-STAT3 axis with cell migration signaling using a 
STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic®) and a pull down assay for the RhoGTPase Rac1 
activity.
RESULTS: It was observed a ~2 fold predominance of M2 over M1 macrophages and a 
pro-inflammatory state in OSCC fragments. The M2 conditioned media increased 
migration speed and directionality of highly invasive OSCC cells (SCC25). OSCC 
cell lines were responsive to cytokine stimuli (IL6, IL-1β and TNF-α), but only 
IL-6 increased migration properties of OSCC cells. This effect was dependent on 
STAT3-phosphorylation levels, which interfered with Rac1 activation levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the inflammatory milieu might favor 
invasion and metastasis of OSCC by the direct effect of macrophage-related 
cytokines on tumor migration.

As hematopoietic progenitors supply a large number of blood cells, therapeutic 
strategies targeting hematopoietic progenitors are potentially beneficial to 
eliminate unwanted blood cells, such as leukemic cells and immune cells causing 
diseases. However, due to their pluripotency, targeting those cells may impair 
the production of multiple cell lineages, leading to serious side effects such 
as anemia and increased susceptibility to infection. To minimize those side 
effects, it is important to identify monopotent progenitors that give rise to a 
particular cell lineage. Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages play 
important roles in the development of inflammatory diseases and tumors. 
Recently, we identified human monocyte-restricted progenitors, namely, common 
monocyte progenitors and pre-monocytes, both of which express high levels of 
CD64, a well-known monocyte marker. Here, we introduce a dimeric 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine (dPBD)-conjugated anti-CD64 antibody (anti-CD64-dPBD) that 
selectively induces the apoptosis of proliferating human monocyte-restricted 
progenitors but not non-proliferating mature monocytes. Treatment with 
anti-CD64-dPBD did not affect other types of hematopoietic cells including 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets, 
suggesting that its off-target effects are negligible. In line with these 
findings, treatment with anti-CD64-dPBD directly killed proliferating monocytic 
leukemia cells and prevented monocytic leukemia cell generation from bone marrow 
progenitors of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients in a patient-derived 
xenograft model. Furthermore, by depleting the source of monocytes, treatment 
with anti-CD64-dPBD ultimately eliminated tumor-associated macrophages and 
significantly reduced tumor size in humanized mice bearing solid tumors. Given 
the selective action of anti-CD64-dPBD on proliferating monocyte progenitors and 
monocytic leukemia cells, it should be a promising tool to target cancers and 
other monocyte-related inflammatory disorders with minimal side effects on other 
cell lineages.

Overexpression of P2X7R has been observed in several tumours and is related to 
cancer advancement and metastasis. However, the role of P2X7R in colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients is not well understood. In the current study, 
overexpression of P2X7R and the effects at the molecular and functional levels 
in CRC were assessed in a mouse orthotopic model. Functional assays, such as the 
CCK-8 assay, wound healing and transwell assay, were used to determine the 
biological role of P2X7R in CRC cells. CSC-related genes and properties were 
detected via sphere formation and real-time PCR assays. The underlying 
mechanisms were explored by Western blotting, real-time PCR and Flow cytometry. 
In this study, we found that overexpression of P2X7R increases in the in vivo 
growth of tumours. P2X7R overexpression also increased CD31, VEGF and concurrent 
angiogenesis. P2X7R up-regulates aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) and CSC 
characteristics. Transplanted tumour cells with P2X7R overexpression stimulated 
cytokines to recruit tumour-associated macrophage (TAMs) to increase the growth 
of tumours. We also found that the NF-κB signalling pathway is involved in 
P2X7R-induced cytokine up-regulation. P2X7R promotes NF-κB-dependent cytokine 
induction, which leads to TAM recruitment to control tumour growth and 
advancement and remodelling of the stroma. Our findings demonstrate that P2X7R 
plays a key role in TAM recruitment, which may be a therapeutic target for CRC 
patients.

Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are thought to underlie glioma initiation, evolution, 
resistance to therapies, and relapse. They are defined by their capacity to 
initiate glioma in immunocompromised mice which precludes analysis of their 
interaction with immune cells. Macrophages dominate the immune cell composition 
in glioma. We hypothesized that stemness and immune evasion induced by 
macrophages are closed intertwined in glioma. By using mass cytometry and RNA 
sequencing, we reveal that in immunocompetent mice, FGL2 promotes the stem-like 
phenotypes of glioma cells in an expression level-dependent manner. 
Mechanistically, FGL2-producing glioma cells recruit macrophages into the tumor 
microenvironment and induce the macrophages to secrete CXCL7 via the 
CD16/SyK/PI3K/HIF1α pathways. CXCL7, in turn, enhances the stem-like 
functionality of glioma cells, resulting in an increase in tumor incidence and 
progression that can be blocked with a neutralizing anti-CXCL7 antibody. 
Clinically, the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine loop positively correlated with a higher 
macrophage signature and poorer prognosis in glioma patients. Thus, glioma 
cells' stem-like functionality is regulated by FGL2 in the presence of 
macrophages, and the FGL2-CXCL7 paracrine signaling axis is critical for 
regulating this function.

Crosstalk between costimulatory and coinhibitory ligands are a prominent node of 
immune cell regulation. Mounting evidence points toward a critical role for 
CD155, the poliovirus receptor, in suppressing T cell function, particularly in 
cancer. However, relative to other known costimulatory/coinhibitory ligands 
(e.g., CD86, CD80, PD-L1), the physiological functions of CD155 and the 
mechanisms controlling its expression remain unclear. We discovered that CD155 
expression is coregulated with PD-L1 on tumor-associated macrophages, is 
transcriptionally regulated by persistently active aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR), and can be targeted for suppression via AhR inhibition in vivo. 
Therapeutic inhibition of AhR reversed tumor immunosuppression in an immune 
competent murine tumor model, and markers of AhR activity were highly correlated 
with tumor-associated macrophage markers in human glioblastomas. Thus, CD155 
functions within a broader, AhR-controlled macrophage activation phenotype that 
can be targeted to reverse tumor immunosuppression.

There are data to suggest that some ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may evolve 
through an evolutionary bottleneck, where minor clones susceptible to the 
imposed selective pressure drive disease progression. Here, we tested the 
hypothesis that an impact of the inflammatory environment on DCIS evolution is 
HER2-dependent, conferring proliferative dominance of HER2-negative cells. In 
tissue samples, density of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) was 
associated only with high tumour nuclear grade, but in 9% of predominantly 
HER2-negative cases, the presence of tumoral foci ('hot-spots') of basal-like 
cells with HIF1-α activity adjacent to the areas of dense stromal infiltration 
was noted. Results of in vitro analyses further demonstrated that IL-1β and 
TNF-α as well as macrophage-conditioned medium triggered phosphorylation of 
NF-κB and subsequent upregulation of COX2 and HIF1-α, exclusively in 
HER2-negative cells. Treatment with both IL-1β and TNF-α resulted in growth 
stimulation and inhibition of HER2-negative and HER2-positive cells, 
respectively. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of HIF1-α rescued HER2-positive 
cells from the negative effect of IL-1β and TNF-α on cell growth. Our data 
provide novel insight into the molecular basis of HER2-dependent proliferation 
of DCIS cells and indicate the NF-κB/COX2 → HIF1-α signalling axis as a dominant 
mechanism of DCIS evolution induced by inflammatory microenvironment. Presented 
findings also highlight the clinical significance of heterogeneity of DCIS 
tumours and suggest that HIF1-α might be considered as a predictive marker of 
disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested the important roles of CD47 and 
tumor-associated macrophages in the prognosis and immunotherapy of various human 
malignancies. However, the clinical significance of CD47 expression and CD163+ 
TAMs in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, 47 well-differentiated PanNET resection specimens were 
collected. CD47 expression and CD163+ macrophages were evaluated using 
immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinicopathologic properties.
RESULTS: Positive CD47 staining was seen in all PanNETs as well as adjacent 
normal islets. Compared to normal islets, CD47 overexpressed in PanNETs 
(p = 0.0015). In the cohort, lymph node metastasis (LNM), lymphovascular 
invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI) were found in 36.2, 59.6, and 
48.9% of the cases, respectively. Interestingly, PanNETs with LNM, LVI, or PNI 
had significantly lower H-score of CD47 than those without LNM (p = 0.035), LVI 
(p = 0.0005), or PNI (p = 0.0035). PanNETs in patients with disease progression 
(recurrence/death) also showed a significantly lower expression of CD47 than 
those without progression (p = 0.022). In contrast, CD163+ macrophage counts 
were significantly higher in cases with LNM, LVI, and PNI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest relative low CD47 expression and high CD163+ TAMs 
may act as indicators for poor prognosis of PanNETs.

The immune system is a fine modulator of the tumor biology supporting or 
inhibiting its progression, growth, invasion and conveys the pharmacological 
treatment effect. Tumors, on their side, have developed escaping mechanisms from 
the immune system action ranging from the direct secretion of biochemical 
signals to an indirect reaction, in which the cellular actors of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) collaborate to mechanically condition the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) making it inhospitable to immune cells. TME is composed of several 
cell lines besides cancer cells, including tumor-associated macrophages, 
cancer-associated fibroblasts, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and innate immunity 
cells. These populations interface with each other to prepare a conservative 
response, capable of evading the defense mechanisms implemented by the host's 
immune system. The presence or absence, in particular, of cytotoxic CD8+ cells 
in the vicinity of the main tumor mass, is able to predict, respectively, the 
success or failure of drug therapy. Among various mechanisms of immunescaping, 
in this study, we characterized the modulation of the phenotypic profile of CD4+ 
and CD8+ cells in resting and activated states, in response to the mechanical 
pressure exerted by a three-dimensional in vitro system, able to recapitulate 
the rheological and stiffness properties of the tumor ECM.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the lethal gynecological diseases in women. 
However, using tumor microenvironment related genes to identify prognostic 
signature of ovarian cancer has not been discussed in detail.
METHODS: The mRNA profiles of 386 ovarian cancer patients were retrieved from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas. Univariate Cox regression and LASSO Cox regression 
analyses were performed and 14 optimized prognostic genes related to tumor 
microenvironment were identified.
RESULTS: The multivariate Cox hazards regression showed risk score was an 
independent prognostic signature for ovarian cancer. Nomogram model could 
reliably predict the patients' survival. Furthermore, M1 macrophages, M2 
macrophages, and follicular helper T cells, differentially expressed between the 
high- and low-risk groups, were found to be associated with the risk score.
CONCLUSION: CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 
(IDO1), which were previously shown to be important immune checkpoints, probably 
contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment aberration. This study may 
shed light on the prognosis of ovarian cancer.

BACKGROUND: As a new method for predicting tumor prognosis, the predictive 
effect of immune-related gene pairs (IRGPs) has been confirmed in several 
cancers, but there is no comprehensive analysis of the clinical significance of 
IRGPs in gastric cancer (GC).
METHOD: Clinical and gene expression profile data of GC patients were obtained 
from the GEO database. Based on the ImmPort database, differentially expressed 
immune-related gene (DEIRG) events were determined by a comparison of GC samples 
and adjacent normal samples. Cox proportional regression was used to construct 
an IRGP signature, and its availability was validated using three external 
validation datasets. In addition, we explored the association between clinical 
data and immune features and established a nomogram to predict outcomes in GC 
patients.
RESULT: A total of 88 DEIRGs were identified in GC from the training set, which 
formed 3828 IRGPs. Fourteen overall survival (OS)-related IRGPs were used to 
construct the prognostic signature. As a result, patients in the high-risk group 
exhibited poorer OS compared to those in the low-risk group. In addition, the 
fraction of CD8+ T cells, plasma cells, CD4 memory activated T cells, and M1 
macrophages was higher in the high-risk group. Expression of two immune 
checkpoints, CD276 and VTCN1, was significantly higher in the high-risk group as 
well. Based on the independent prognostic factors, a nomogram was established 
and showed excellent performance.
CONCLUSION: The 14 OS-related IRGP signature was associated with OS, immune 
cells, and immune checkpoints in GC patients, and it could provide the basis for 
related immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inflammation associated with the tumour microenvironment 
(TME) is critical for cancer development, and immunotherapeutic strategies 
modulating the immune response in cancer have been crucial. In this study, a 
methotrexate-loaded (MTX) poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-based (PLGA) drug 
nanocarrier covered with polyethyleneimine (Pei) and hyaluronic acid (HA) was 
developed and combined with an PD-L1 antibody to investigate anti-cancer and 
immunomodulatory effects in breast cancer TME.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Naked or HA-coated PeiPLGA-MTX nanoparticles (NPs) were 
assessed on 4T1 breast cancer cells grown in culture and in a mouse model of 
orthotopic tumour growth. Tumours were evaluated by qRT-PCR and 
immunohistochemistry. The cell death profile and cell migration were analysed in 
vitro in 4T1 cells. Polarization of murine macrophages (RAW cells) was also 
carried out.
KEY RESULTS: Naked or HA-coated PeiPLGA-MTX NPs used alone or combined with 
PD-L1 antibody modified the tumourigenic course by TME immunomodulation, leading 
to reduction of primary tumour size and metastases. STAT3 and NF-κB were the 
major genes downregulated by NPs. In tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) such 
regulation switched M2 phenotype (CD163) towards M1 (CD68) and reduced levels of 
IL-10, TGF-β and CCL22. Moreover, malignant cells showed overexpression of FADD, 
APAF-1, caspase-3 and E-cadherin, and decreased expression of Bcl-2, MDR-1, 
survivin, vimentin, CXCR4 and PD-L1 after treatment with NPs.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: NPs-mediated STAT3/NF-κB signalling axis 
suppression disrupted crosstalk between immune and malignant cells, reducing 
immunosuppression and critical pro-tumour events. These findings provide a 
promising therapeutic approach capable of guiding the immune TME to suppress the 
development of breast cancer.

Bromodomain 4 (BRD4), a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain 
protein family, has become a promising epigenetic target in cancer and 
inflammatory diseases; however, the detailed biological role of BRD4 in breast 
cancer (BRCA) remains undetermined. We analysed the BRD4 expression levels using 
the Oncomine and TIMER databases and evaluated the clinical impact of BRD4 on 
BRCA prognosis using Kaplan-Meier plot and PrognoScan. The correlation between 
BRD4 and tumour-infiltrating immune cells was investigated using TIMER. 
Furthermore, the correlation between BRD4 expression levels was also analysed 
using TIMER in addition to the GEPIA database for immune cell gene markers. BRD4 
expression was significantly higher in BRCA tissues than in normal tissues, 
which was significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS). 
Specifically, high BRD4 expression was correlated with worse OS and 
progression-free survival in patients with BRCA. In addition, BRD4 expression 
was correlated with levels of infiltrating monocytes (CSF1R, cor = 0.204, 
P = 9.19e-12), tumour-associated macrophages (CD68, cor = 0.129, P = 1.81e-05), 
M1/M2 macrophages and different effector T cells (including Th1/Th2/Treg) in 
BRCA. These findings suggest that BRD4 could be used as a prognostic biomarker 
for determining prognosis and immune cell infiltration levels in BRCA.

Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) encompass dendritic cells, monocytes, and 
macrophages (MoMac), which exhibit antimicrobial, homeostatic, and 
immunoregulatory functions. We integrated 178,651 MNPs from 13 tissues across 41 
datasets to generate a MNP single-cell RNA compendium (MNP-VERSE), a publicly 
available tool to map MNPs and define conserved gene signatures of MNP 
populations. Next, we generated a MoMac-focused compendium that revealed an 
array of specialized cell subsets widely distributed across multiple tissues. 
Specific pathological forms were expanded in cancer and inflammation. All 
neoplastic tissues contained conserved tumor-associated macrophage populations. 
In particular, we focused on IL4I1+CD274(PD-L1)+IDO1+ macrophages, which 
accumulated in the tumor periphery in a T cell-dependent manner via interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ) and CD40/CD40L-induced maturation from IFN-primed monocytes. IL4I1_Macs 
exhibited immunosuppressive characteristics through tryptophan degradation and 
promoted the entry of regulatory T cell into tumors. This integrated analysis 
provides a robust online-available platform for uniform annotation and 
dissection of specific macrophage functions in healthy and pathological states.

Diffuse large cell B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for approximately 30%-40% of 
all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases. Current first line DLBCL treatment results 
in long-term remission in more than 60% of cases. However, those patients with 
primary refractory disease or early relapse exhibit poor prognosis, highlighting 
a requirement for alternative therapies. Our aim was to develop a novel model of 
DLBCL that facilitates in vitro testing of current and novel therapies by 
replicating key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a 
three-dimensional (3D) culture system that would enable primary DLBCL cell 
survival and study ex vivo. The TME is a complex ecosystem, comprising malignant 
and non-malignant cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) whose reciprocal crosstalk drives tumor 
initiation and growth while fostering an immunosuppressive milieu enabling its 
persistence. The requirement to recapitulate, at least to some degree, this 
complex, interactive network is exemplified by the rapid cell death of primary 
DLBCL cells removed from their TME and cultured alone in vitro. Building on 
previously described methodologies to generate lymphoid-like fibroblasts from 
adipocyte derived stem cells (ADSC), we confirmed lymphocytes, specifically B 
cells, interacted with this ADSC-derived stroma, in the presence or absence of 
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), in both two-dimensional (2D) cultures and a 
3D collagen-based spheroid system. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DLBCL cells 
cultured in this system interact with its constituent components, resulting in 
their improved viability as compared to ex-vivo 2D monocultures. We then 
assessed the utility of this system as a platform to study therapeutics in the 
context of antibody-directed phagocytosis, using rituximab as a model 
immunotherapeutic antibody. Overall, we describe a novel 3D spheroid co-culture 
system comprising key components of the DLBCL TME with the potential to serve as 
a testbed for novel therapeutics, targeting key cellular constituents of the 
TME, such as CAF and/or TAM.

Immune-based rather than cancer-based classification systems are becoming an 
important additional component for prognostic prediction. Herein, we investigate 
the status of tumor-immune interaction and prognostic value of immune activity 
scores in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 
(KIRC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset 
and tracking the tumor immunophenotype platform. Traditional clinicopathological 
parameters still are effective predictors for prognosis. Comparison of 23-set, 
seven-step immune activity scores, and its distribution between favorable and 
adverse outcome groups within each cancer type and among cancer types show that 
each cancer has a distinct tumor-immune pattern. Adjusted overall immune 
activity scores based on the binary logistic regression analysis show a great 
discrimination ability in the progression-free survival (p = .0056 in BLCA, 
p < .0001 in KIRC, and p < .0001 in PRAD). K-mean cluster method and principal 
component analysis were performed to explore the cancer subtype. The results 
reveal that certain immune activity scores pattern such as high nature killer 
(NK) cell, T cell, macrophage, T helper type 1 (Th1) cell, and dendritic cell 
recruiting scores in BLCA, low NK cell, CD8 T cell, macrophage, T cell, Th1 cell 
recruiting scores in KIRC have a favorable clinical outcome comparing to other 
subtypes. Also, It is remarkable that a relatively small subtype of patients has 
a poor clinical prognosis in PRAD and this subtype features high CD4 T cell, 
macrophage, T cell, and regulatory T cell recruiting scores.

Melanoma is a life-threatening form of skin cancer with an elevated risk of 
metastasis and high mortality rates. The prognosis and clinical outcomes of 
cancer immunotherapy in melanoma patients are influenced by immune cell 
infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the expression of genetic 
factors. Despite reports suggesting that immune-classification may have a better 
prediction of prognosis compared to the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union 
for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) TNM-classification, the definition 
of Immunoscore in melanoma is becoming a difficult challenge. In this study, we 
established and verified a 7-gene prognostic signature. Melanoma patients from 
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were separated into a low-risk group and a 
high-risk group using the median risk score. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analysis for overall survival (OS) showed that the area under the curve 
(AUC) was 0.701 for 1 year, 0.726 for 3 years, and 0.745 for 5 years, 
respectively. Moreover, a nomogram was constructed as a practical prognostic 
tool, and the AUC was 0.829 for 3 years, and 0.803 for 5 years, respectively. 
Furthermore, we validated the above results in two datasets from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the relationship between 7-gene prognostic 
signature and immune infiltration estimated.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an advanced stage of prostate 
cancer that can progress rapidly even in patients treated with castration. 
Previously, we found that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can be recruited by 
CSF-1 secreted by docetaxel-treated prostate cancer cells and promote the 
survival of cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. The inhibition of CSF-1R 
can impede this effect and significantly prolong survival in xenograft mice. 
However, the actual mechanism of how TAM improves cancer cell survival still 
remains elusive and controversial. Here, for the first time, we found that the 
enhanced survival of cancer cells achieved by TAM was mainly mediated by CXCR4 
activation from the increased secretion of CXCL12 from CSF-1 activated TAM. This 
finding helps to clarify the mechanism of chemoresistance for second-line 
chemotherapy using docetaxel, facilitating the development of novel drugs to 
overcome immune tolerance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Among the innate and adaptative immune cells recruited to the tumour site, 
tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) are particularly abundant and by simplified 
classification can be classified into (M1) and (M2) TAMs. In the present study, 
we quantified by immunohistochemistry ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 
(Iba1)-positive total and CD204-positive M2-polarized TAMs in 60 canine 
malignant mammary tumours (CMMTs) to analyze the relationship between M1 or M2 
response and the histopathologic features of examined CMMTs, the dogs' body 
condition score (BCS) and the progression of the neoplastic disease. The mean 
number of total and CD204+ TAMS were significantly higher in solid and in grade 
III than in grades I and II carcinomas. Moreover, the mean number of 
CD204-positive TAMs was significantly higher in CMMTs with lymphatic invasion 
and necrosis rather than CMMTs without. The presence of higher number of 
CD204-positive M2-polarized TAMs was associated with a worst outcome of the 
neoplastic disease: bitches bearing CMMTs with a prevalent M2-polarized TAM 
response had a median cancer-specific survival time of 449 days, while in 
animals with a M1-polarized TAM response the median cancer-specific survival 
time was 1209 days. The results of our study confirm that in CMMTs the presence 
of a M2-polarized TAMs response might affect the tumour development and 
behaviour. Finally, it strongly suggests the potential of CD204 expression as a 
prognostic factor.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive cancer with a long 
latency period and dismal prognosis. Recently, tazemetostat (EPZ-6438), an 
inhibitor of the histone methyltransferase EZH2, has entered clinical trials due 
to the antiproliferative effects reported on MPM cells. However, the direct and 
indirect effects of epigenetic reprogramming on the tumor microenvironment are 
hitherto unexplored. To investigate the impact of tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs) on MPM cell responsiveness to tazemetostat, we developed a 
three-dimensional MPM spheroid model that recapitulates in vitro, both 
monocytes' recruitment in tumors and their functional differentiation toward a 
TAM-like phenotype (Mo-TAMs). Along with an increased expression of genes for 
monocyte chemoattractants, inhibitory immune checkpoints, immunosuppressive and 
M2-like molecules, Mo-TAMs promote tumor cell proliferation and spreading. 
Prolonged treatment of MPM spheroids with tazemetostat enhances both the 
recruitment of Mo-TAMs and the expression of their protumor phenotype. 
Therefore, Mo-TAMs profoundly suppress the antiproliferative effects due to EZH2 
inhibition in MPM cells. Overall, our findings indicate that TAMs are a driving 
force for MPM growth, progression, and resistance to tazemetostat; therefore, 
strategies of TAM depletion might be evaluated to improve the therapeutic 
efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of EZH2.

Gliomas are the most common and lethal primary malignant tumor of the brain. 
Routine treatment including surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy 
produced limited therapeutic effect, while immunotherapy targeting the glioma 
microenvironment has offered a novel therapeutic option. PDIA5 protein is the 
member of PDI family, which is highly expressed in glioma and participates in 
glioma progression. Based on large-scale bioinformatics analysis, we discovered 
that PDIA5 expression level is upregulated in aggressive gliomas, with high 
PDIA5 expression predicting poor clinical outcomes. We also observed positive 
correlation between PDIA5 and immune infiltrating cells, immune related 
pathways, inflammatory activities, and other immune checkpoint members. Patients 
with high PDIA5 high-expression benefited from immunotherapies. Additionally, 
immunohistochemistry revealed that PDIA5 and macrophage biomarker CD68 were 
upregulated in high-grade gliomas, and patients with low PDIA5 level experienced 
favorable outcomes among 33 glioma patients. Single cell RNA sequencing 
exhibited that PDIA5 was in high level presenting in neoplastic cells and 
macrophages. Cell transfection and co-culture of glioma cells and macrophages 
revealed that PDIA5 in tumor cells mediated macrophages exhausting. Altogether, 
our findings indicate that PDIA5 overexpression is associated with immune 
infiltration in gliomas, and may be a promising therapeutic target for glioma 
immunotherapy.

Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most 
common malignancy worldwide, and the prognosis of HNSCC remains bleak. Numerous 
studies revealed that the tumor mutation burden (TMB) could predict the survival 
outcomes of a variety of tumors. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the 
TMB and immune cell infiltration in these patients and construct an 
immune-related genes (IRGs) prognostic model. Methods: The expression data of 
546 HNSCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. 
All patients were divided into high- and low- TMB groups, and the relationship 
between TMB and clinical relevance was further analyzed. The differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the R software package, limma. 
Functional enrichment analyses were conducted to identify the significantly 
enriched pathways between two groups. CIBERSORT algorithm was adopted to 
calculate the abundance of 22 leukocyte subtypes. The IRGs prognostic model was 
constructed via the multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: Missense 
mutation and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were the most predominant mutation 
types in HNSCC. TP53, TTN, and FAT1 were the most frequently mutated genes. 
Patients with high TMB were observed with worse survival outcomes. The 
functional analysis of TMB associated DEGs showed that the identified DEGs 
mainly involved in spliceosome, RNA degradation, proteasome, and RNA polymerase 
pathways. We observed that macrophages, T cells CD8, and T cells CD4 memory were 
the most commonly infiltrated subtypes of immune cells in HNSCC. Finally, an 
IRGs prognostic model was constructed, and the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.635. 
Conclusions: Our results suggest that high TMB is associated with poor prognosis 
in HNSCC patients. The constructed model has potential prognostic value for the 
prognosis of these individuals, and it needs to be further validated in 
large-scale and prospective studies.

Rare cases of aggressive B-cell lymphomas with a morphology similar to Burkitt 
lymphoma (BL) present with the BL-typical immunophenotype, but lacked MYC 
translocation (MYC-negative Burkitt-like lymphoma: mnBLL). A proportion of those 
with an imbalance pattern in chromosome 11q has been designated Burkitt-like 
lymphoma with 11q aberration in the recent update of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification. Because of the problems in the identification 
of Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration, our goal was to retrospectively 
analyze their frequency in a cohort of "candidate" aggressive lymphomas (cohort 
1, n=35) such as mnBLL (n=16), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with similarities 
to Burkitt lymphoma (DLBCL-BL; n=3), high-grade B-cell lymphomas, not otherwise 
specified (NOS) (n=16), as well as in a cohort of MYC-negative diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma NOS (cohort 2, n=62). In total, 17/33 cohort 1 cases (52%) 
harbored the typical 11q aberration pattern, predominantly those that had been 
classified as mnBLL (12/16, 75%), but also as DLBCL-BL (2/3, 67%) and high-grade 
B-cell lymphomas, NOS (3/14; 21%). The specimens with this typical 11q 
aberration pattern were usually negative for the BCL2 protein. Of interest and 
as a new finding, samples harboring the 11q aberration pattern were often 
characterized by strikingly coarse apoptotic debris within starry sky 
macrophages facilitating their recognition. In contrast, only 1 of 62 garden 
variety DLBCL, NOS was positive for the 11q aberration pattern. In 2 DLBCL-BL, a 
dual MYC translocation/11q aberration pattern was detected. As a diagnostic 
algorithm, we, therefore, propose analysis of 11q status in MYC-negative 
high-grade lymphomas with features of BL, especially showing BCL2 negativity and 
a conspicuous coarse apoptotic debris in starry sky macrophages.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the effect of cluster 
differentiation (CD)39 and CD73 inhibitors on the expresion of tumour-associated 
macrophages (TAMs), M1- versus M2-tumour phenotypes in mice with colon cancer.
METHODS: An in vivo study of co-culture with colon cancer cells and immune cells 
from the bone marrow (BM) of mice was performed. After the confirmation of the 
effect of polyoxotungstate (POM-1) as an inhibitor of CD39 on TAMs, the mice 
were randomly divided into a control group without POM-1 and a study group with 
POM-1, respectively, after subcutaneous injection of CT26 cells. On day 14 after 
the injection, the mice were sacrificed, and TAMs were evaluated using 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
RESULTS: In the in vivo study, the co-culture with POM-1 significantly increased 
the apoptosis of CT26 cells. The cell population from the co-culture with POM-1 
showed significant increases in the expression of CD11b+ for myeloid cells, 
lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C (Ly6C+) for monocytes, M1-tumour 
phenotypes from TAMs, and F4/80+ for macrophages. In the in vivo study, tumour 
growth in the study group with POM-1 was significantly limited, compared with 
the control group without POM-1. The expressions of Ly6C+ and major 
histocompatibility complex class II+ for M1-tumour phenotypes from TAMs on 
F4/80+ from the tumour tissue in the study group had significantly higher values 
compared with the control group.
CONCLUSION: The inhibition of CD39 with POM-1 prevented the growth of colon 
cancer in mice, and it was associated with the increased expression of M1-tumour 
phenotypes from TAMs in the cancer tissue.

BACKGROUND: Diacylglycerol-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) plays an important role in 
the energy storage and is involved in cancer progression. A growing number of 
evidences showed that elevated expression of DGAT1 in cancer tissue indicated a 
poor outcome in cancer patients. However, the relationship between DGAT1 and 
gastric cancer is still unclear. Thus, Transcriptomic analysis and in vitro 
experiments were performed to investigate the role of DGAT1 in gastric cancer, 
as well as the potential therapy target in gastric cancer treatment.
METHODS: We screened the public cancer datasets to identify the expression and 
function of DGAT1 in gastric cancer and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Then we 
testified the DGAT1 expression and function after sodium oleate treatment in AGS 
and MKN45 cell line. Finally, we analyzed ration of apoptosis, necrosis in 
gastric cancer cells by using flow cytometry after administration of DGAT1 
inhibitor.
RESULTS: Our results showed a highly expression of DGAT1 in gastric cancer 
tissues (n = 5, p = 0.0004), and tumor-infiltrating macrophages with elevated 
DGAT1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in gastric cancer 
patients. In addition, gastric cell lines AGS (n = 3, p < 0.05) and MKN45 
(n = 3, p < 0.01) expressed higher level of DGAT1 than human gastric mucosal 
epithelial cell line GES-1. Administration of DGAT1 inhibitor effectively 
suppressed functional factors expression and induced cell death in MKN45.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this research provide an in-depth insight into the 
potential role and influences involved in DGAT1 in the gastric cancer patients. 
And higher expression of DGAT1 leads to lower overall survival (OS) rate in 
patients with poorly differentiated gastric cancer. Our findings suggest a 
potential role for DGAT1 in the gastric cancer progression and inhibiting DGAT1 
might be a promising strategy in gastric cancer treatment.

Background: In a Phase II study RRx-001 was combined with Etoposide platinum 
(EP) in previously platinum treated SCLC. We correlated expression of the M2 
marker, CD206, on HLA-DRlow/- monocytes, a phenotype that correlates with a poor 
prognosis, with response to RRx-001. Research design and methods: Patients 
received 4 mg RRx-001 once weekly until progression followed by the start of EP 
(etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle and either cisplatin 
80 mg/m2 IV on day 1 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 IV on day 1). Treatment continued 
until progression or intolerable toxicity. Peripheral blood was collected in 
Cell Preparation Tubes with sodium citrate from 14 patients for exploratory 
studies during screening and after therapy on Days 1, 8, and 15. Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood by centrifugation and 
multiparameter flow cytometric analysis was performed. Results: CD206 expression 
on HLA-DRlow/- monocytes was associated with response to chemotherapy and 
overall survival. Conclusion: During treatment with RRx-001, reduced expression 
of the protumorigenic M2 marker CD206 on peripheral monocytes positively 
correlated with increased response and survival.

RATIONALE: Anti-PD-1 antibody is the standard therapy for treatment-resistant 
gastric cancer, but only a limited number of patients respond. Additionally, 
cases of hyper-progressive disease (HPD) in which tumor growth accelerates after 
anti-PD-1 antibody administration have been reported; however, the biological 
mechanism has not been elucidated.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In the present case, metastatic gastric cancer was treated 
with the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, as third-line treatment.
DIAGNOSIS: After the initiation of nivolumab therapy, a rapidly enlarging 
para-aortic lymph nodes were observed leading to the diagnosis of HPD.
INTERVENTIONS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to examine immune cells 
infiltrating in the primary tumor and in liver metastasis which were obtained 
before nivolumab treatment, and in lymph node metastasis which presented with 
HPD after nivolumab therapy.
OUTCOMES: In the primary tumor, helper T (Th) cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes 
(CTLs), regulatory T (Treg) cells, and PD-L1-negative macrophages were observed. 
On the other hand, in metastatic lymph nodes presenting with HPD, PD-L1-positive 
macrophages prominently increased, while Treg cells, CTLs, and Th cells 
decreased. PD-L1 expression was not observed in gastric cancer cells among the 
three specimens.
LESSONS: The findings suggest the possibility that PD-L1-positive M2 macrophage 
might contribute to acceleration of tumor growth with anti-PD-1 therapy in the 
present case.

Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain cancers that recur as 
therapy-resistant tumors. Myeloid cells control glioblastoma malignancy, but 
their dynamics during disease progression remain poorly understood. Here, we 
employed single-cell RNA sequencing and CITE-seq to map the glioblastoma immune 
landscape in mouse tumors and in patients with newly diagnosed disease or 
recurrence. This revealed a large and diverse myeloid compartment, with 
dendritic cell and macrophage populations that were conserved across species and 
dynamic across disease stages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) consisted of 
microglia- or monocyte-derived populations, with both exhibiting additional 
heterogeneity, including subsets with conserved lipid and hypoxic signatures. 
Microglia- and monocyte-derived TAMs were self-renewing populations that 
competed for space and could be depleted via CSF1R blockade. Microglia-derived 
TAMs were predominant in newly diagnosed tumors, but were outnumbered by 
monocyte-derived TAMs following recurrence, especially in hypoxic tumor 
environments. Our results unravel the glioblastoma myeloid landscape and provide 
a framework for future therapeutic interventions.

Polysaccharide is one of main components in Polygonatum sibiricum (PS), which is 
an herbal medicine widely used in East Asia. Polysaccharides from Polygonatum 
sibiricum has been shown to exhibit multiple biological activities, such as 
anti-diabetes, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, immunity modulation, and 
anticancer. Since hematopoietic system is one of determinant factors in cancer 
control, we here explored the effect of polysaccharide-rich extract from 
Polygonatum sibiricum (PREPS) on hematopoiesis in the mice bearing triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC). We found that the 4T1 TNBC tumor significantly 
increased myeloid cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen, while 
decreasing bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), 
indicative of an inhibition of medullary hematopoiesis. When 4T1 TNBC 
tumor-bearing mice were treated with PREPS, the percentage of myeloid cells 
within tumor-infiltrating immune cells was reduced. In addition, PREPS also 
inhibited hematopoietic cell expansion in the spleen, which was induced by TNBC 
tumors. Importantly, PREPS markedly increased HSPCs and common lymphoid 
progenitors in the bone marrow that had been suppressed by TNBC tumors. These 
findings suggest that PREPS protect hematopoiesis inhibited by TNBC tumors in 
the bone marrow. Although PREPS alone did not achieve statistical significance 
in the suppression of TNBC tumor growth, it may have a long-lasting anti-tumor 
effect to assist TNBC therapies by sustaining hematopoiesis and lymphoid 
regeneration in bone marrow.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most common urinary tract 
malignant tumors. It is associated with poor outcomes, and its etiology and 
pathogenesis are not fully understood. There is great hope for immunotherapy in 
treating many malignant tumors; therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the use 
of immunotherapy for BLCA.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical information were obtained from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and immune-related genes (IRGs) were downloaded 
from the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal. Differentially-expressed and 
survival-associated IRGs in patients with BLCA were identified using 
computational algorithms and Cox regression analysis. We also performed 
functional enrichment analysis. Based on IRGs, we employed multivariate Cox 
analysis to develop a new prognostic index.
RESULTS: We identified 261 IRGs that were differentially expressed between BLCA 
tissue and adjacent tissue, 30 of which were significantly associated with the 
overall survival (all P<0.01). According to multivariate Cox analysis, nine 
survival-related IRGs (MMP9, PDGFRA, AHNAK, OAS1, OLR1, RAC3, IGF1, PGF, and 
SH3BP2) were high-risk genes. We developed a prognostic index based on these 
IRGs and found it accurately predicted BLCA outcomes associated with the TNM 
stage. Intriguingly, the IRG-based prognostic index reflected infiltration of 
macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: An independent IRG-based prognostic index provides a practical 
approach for assessing patients' immune status and prognosis with BLCA. This 
index independently predicted outcomes of BLCA.

Tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts key roles in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development. However, the factors regulating the 
cross-talk between PDAC cells and TME are largely unknown. In the present study, 
we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) KLHDC7B divergent transcript 
(KLHDC7B-DT), which was up-regulated in PDAC and correlated with poor survival 
of PDAC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that KLHDC7B-DT enhanced PDAC 
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, KLHDC7B-DT was 
found to directly bind IL-6 promoter, induce open chromatin structure at IL-6 
promoter region, activate IL-6 transcription, and up-regulate IL-6 expression 
and secretion. The expression of KLHDC7B-DT was positively correlated with IL-6 
in PDAC tissues. Via inducing IL-6 secretion, KLHDC7B-DT activated STAT3 
signaling in PDAC cells in an autocrine manner. Furthermore, KLHDC7B-DT also 
activated STAT3 signaling in macrophages in a paracrine manner, which induced 
macrophage M2 polarization. KLHDC7B-DT overexpressed PDAC cells-primed 
macrophages promoted PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Blocking 
IL-6/STAT3 signaling reversed the effects of KLHDC7B-DT on macrophage M2 
polarization and PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In 
conclusion, KLHDC7B-DT enhanced malignant behaviors of PDAC cells via 
IL-6-induced macrophage M2 polarization and IL-6-activated STAT3 signaling in 
PDAC cells. The cross-talk between PDAC cells and macrophages induced by 
KLHDC7B-DT represents potential therapeutic target for PDAC.

Members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) gene family are crucial 
regulators of type I interferon signaling, which may play a role in the 
resistance of glioma to immune checkpoint blockade. However, the expression 
profiles, potential functions, and clinical significance of IRF family members 
remain largely unknown. Here, we examined IRF transcript levels and 
clinicopathological data from glioma patients using several bioinformatic 
databases, including ONCOMINE, GEPIA, TCGA, and cBioPortal. We found that IRF1, 
IRF2, IRF5, IRF8 and IRF9 were significantly upregulated in glioma compared to 
normal brain tissue. Higher IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, IRF4, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8 and IRF9 
mRNA levels correlated with more advanced tumor grades and poorer outcomes. 
Moreover, although IRFs mutation rates were low (ranging from 0.5% to 2.3%) in 
glioma patients, genetic alterations in IRFs were associated with more favorable 
patient survival. Functional analysis showed that IRFs participated in glioma 
pathology mainly through multiple inflammation- and immunity-related pathways. 
Additionally, correlations were identified between IRFs and infiltration of 
immune cells within glioma tissues. Collectively, these results indicate that 
IRF family members, including IRF1, IRF2, IRF5, IRF8 and IRF9, may serve as 
prognostic biomarkers and indicators of immune status in glioma patients.

BACKGROUND: A simple measure of immune cytolytic activity (CYT) base on mRNA 
expression levels of two genes, GZMA and PRF1, was recently reported. Here, we 
aimed to evaluate the CYT score's potential as a measure of antitumor immunity 
and predictor of clinical outcome in gastric cancer (GC) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the correlations between tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells and the CYT score in 238 GC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA). Next, we investigated CYT score associations with molecular subtypes, 
somatic mutation load, and immune checkpoint molecules in GC samples from TCGA 
and Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG). Moreover, we evaluated the clinical 
significance of the CYT score calculated by reverse transcription 
(RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) data in 123 GC samples and the association of the 
CYT score with the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in 7 GC samples from Kyushu 
University Hospital.
RESULTS: The CYT score positively correlated with the proportions of 
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and macrophages and negatively correlated with 
the proportion of regulatory T cells in GC tissues. A high CYT score was 
associated with common immune checkpoint molecules, a high mutation, the 
Epstein-Barr virus subtype, and the microsatellite instability subtype in GC. 
Moreover, a low CYT score was a poor prognosis factor in patients with GC. 
Finally, the CYT score was higher in a responder to anti-PD-1 therapy compared 
to nonresponders.
CONCLUSION: The CYT score reflects antitumor immunity and predicts clinical 
outcome in GC patients.

M2 macrophages can promote liver cancer metastasis by promoting tumour 
angiogenesis; however, the mechanism underlying macrophage polarization has not 
been completely revealed. In this study, we mainly explored the mechanism 
underlying long non-coding RNA-CRNDE (lncRNA-CRNDE) in regulating M2 macrophage 
polarization and promoting liver cancer angiogenesis. The expression of CRNDE 
was up-regulated or down-regulated in THP-1 cells (CRNDE-/- -THP-1 cells and 
pcDNA3.1-CRNDE-THP-1). THP-1 cells were co-cultured with liver cancer cell line 
H22, and M2 polarization was induced in THP-1 by IL-4/13 to simulate 
tumour-induced macrophage polarization. As a result, after CRNDE overexpression, 
THP-1 cell viability was up-regulated, the expression of M2 membrane marker 
CD163 was up-regulated, and the proportion of F4/80 + CD163+ cells was also 
up-regulated. ELISA assay showed that the expression of M2 markers (including 
TGF-β1 and IL-10) and chemokines (including CCl22 and CCL22) was up-regulated, 
and the expression of key signals (including STAT6, JAK-1, p-AKT1, and Arg-1) 
was also up-regulated, which were significantly different compared with the 
control group (Con). In addition, the intervention effect of CRNDE on THP-1 was 
consistent between co-culture with H22 cells and IL-4/13 induction assay. The 
induced M2 THP-1 cells were co-cultured with HUVEC. As a result, THP-1 cells 
with CRNDE overexpression can promote the migration and angiogenesis of HUVEC 
cells in vitro and simultaneously up-regulate the expression of Notch1, Dll4 and 
VEGFR2, indicating that THP-1 M2 polarization induced by CRNDE could further 
promote angiogenesis. The H22 cell tumour-bearing mouse model was constructed, 
followed by injection of CRNDE anti-oligosense nucleotides and overexpression 
plasmids to interfere CRNDE expression in tumour-bearing tissues. Consequently, 
down-regulation of CRNDE could down-regulate tumour volume, simultaneously 
down-regulate the expression of CD163 and CD31 in tissues, decrease the 
expression of key proteins (including JAK-1, STAT-6, p-STAT6 and p-AKT1), and 
down-regulate the expression of key angiogenesis-related proteins (including 
VEGF, Notch1, Dll4 and VEGFR2). In this study, we found that CENDE could 
indirectly regulate tumour angiogenesis by promoting M2 polarization of 
macrophages, which is also one of the mechanisms of microenvironmental immune 
regulation in liver cancer.

Tissue clearing is one of the most powerful strategies for a comprehensive 
analysis of disease progression. Here, we established an integrated pipeline 
that combines tissue clearing, 3D imaging, and machine learning and applied to a 
mouse tumour model of experimental lung metastasis using human lung 
adenocarcinoma A549 cells. This pipeline provided the spatial information of the 
tumour microenvironment. We further explored the role of transforming growth 
factor-β (TGF-β) in cancer metastasis. TGF-β-stimulated cancer cells enhanced 
metastatic colonization of unstimulated-cancer cells in vivo when both cells 
were mixed. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that expression of the genes related 
to coagulation and inflammation were up-regulated in TGF-β-stimulated cancer 
cells. Further, whole-organ analysis revealed accumulation of platelets or 
macrophages with TGF-β-stimulated cancer cells, suggesting that TGF-β might 
promote remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, enhancing the colonization 
of cancer cells. Hence, our integrated pipeline for 3D profiling will help the 
understanding of the tumour microenvironment.

Previously, we showed that chemotherapy paradoxically exacerbated cancer cell 
colonization at the secondary site in a manner dependent on Atf3, a 
stress-inducible gene, in the non-cancer host cells. Here, we present evidence 
that this phenotype is established at an early stage of colonization within days 
of cancer cell arrival. Using mouse breast cancer models, we showed that, in the 
wild-type (WT) lung, cyclophosphamide (CTX) increased the ability of the lung to 
retain cancer cells in the vascular bed. Although CTX did not change the WT lung 
to affect cancer cell extravasation or proliferation, it changed the lung 
macrophage to be pro-cancer, protecting cancer cells from death. This, combined 
with the initial increase in cell retention, resulted in higher lung 
colonization in CTX-treated than control-treated mice. In the Atf3 knockout (KO) 
lung, CTX also increased the ability of lung to retain cancer cells. However, 
the CTX-treated KO macrophage was highly cytotoxic to cancer cells, resulting in 
no increase in lung colonization-despite the initial increase in cell retention. 
In summary, the status of Atf3 dictates the dichotomous activity of macrophage: 
pro-cancer for CTX-treated WT macrophage but anti-cancer for the KO counterpart. 
This dichotomy provides a mechanistic explanation for CTX to exacerbate lung 
colonization in the WT but not Atf3 KO lung.

Lung cancer has the highest death rate among cancers globally. Hepcidin is a 
fascinating regulator of iron metabolism; however, the prognostic value of 
hepcidin and its correlation with immune cell infiltration in lung cancer remain 
unclear. Here, we comprehensively clarified the prognostic value and potential 
function of hepcidin in lung cancer. Hepcidin expression was significantly 
increased in lung cancer. High hepcidin expression was associated with sex, age, 
metastasis, and pathological stage and significantly predicted an unfavorable 
prognosis in lung cancer patients. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results 
suggested that hepcidin is involved in the immune response. Furthermore, 
hepcidin expression was positively correlated with the infiltration levels of 
immune cells and the expression of diverse immune cell marker sets. Importantly, 
hepcidin may affect prognosis partially by regulating immune infiltration in 
lung cancer patients. Hepcidin may serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker for 
determining prognosis associated with immune infiltration in lung cancer.

After extensive screening of aerospace compounds in an effort to source a novel 
anticancer agent, RRx-001, a first-in-class dinitroazetidine small molecule, was 
selected for advancement into preclinical and clinical development. RRx-001 is a 
minimally toxic small molecule with a distinct chemical structure and mechanism 
of action. The paradox of RRx-001 is that it mediates both antitumor 
cytotoxicity and normal tissue protection. The question of exactly how RRx-001 
does this, and by means of what mechanism(s), depending on the route of 
delivery, intravenous or intratumoral, are explored. RRx-001 is currently in 
phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for the treatment of multiple solid tumor 
malignancies and as a supportive care drug.

A 56-year-old male was diagnosed with right lung upper lobe squamous cancer with 
right hilar and mediastinum lymph node metastasis. After four cycles of 
neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, reexamination by computed tomography showed 
progressive disease of the primary lesion. Then, the patient underwent a right 
lung upper lobectomy, and hilar and mediastinum lymph node dissection. Surgical 
pathology showed a partial response to immunochemotherapy. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing was used to characterize the infiltrating immune cell atlas after 
neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy; the most common infiltrating immune cell types 
were cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and macrophages. 
Imaging mass cytometry revealed a transformation from cold to hot tumor after 
neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. In this case study, we are the first to report a 
case of neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy pseudoprogression, proved by surgical 
pathology, single-cell RNA sequencing, and imaging mass cytometry. Both 
single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging mass cytometry revealed an activated 
immune microenvironment after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy.
